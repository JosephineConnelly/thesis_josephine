  abstract = {Plants of eight isolines of soyabean [Glycine max (L,.) Merrill], comprising all combinations of two alleles at the three loci E-1/e(1), E-2/e(2) and E-3/e(3) in the cultivar 'Clark' background, were transferred after different periods following first flowering from long days (LD, 14 h d(-1)) to short days (SD, 12 h d(-1)) and vice versa in a reciprocal-transfer experiment in a plastic house maintained at 30/24 degrees C (day/night). Photoperiod (0.10 \textquestiondown{} P \textexclamdown{} 0.05), transfer time (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001), isoline (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001), and their interactions (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001) all affected flowering duration, i.e. the period from first flowering until the appearance of the last flower. The flowering duration comprised two distinct phases: a photoperiod-sensitive phase beginning at first flowering, and a subsequent photoperiod-insensitive phase. The duration of the photoperiod-sensitive phase varied much more among the isolines in LH) than in SD. Only the dominant allele E-1 increased the sensitivity of the photoperiod-sensitive phase of flowering duration to photoperiod singly, but positive epistatic effects were detected between E-1 and E-2, E-1 and E-3, and especially among all three dominant alleles. The increases in flowering duration resulting from the combined effects of gene and environment (i.e. photoperiod) were associated with considerable increases in biomass and seed yield at harvest maturity.

  abstract = {It is the purpose of this paper to illustrate the impact of geography, climate, and humankind in shaping the present-day genetic diversity in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Examination of soybean germplasm collections around the globe reveals that an enormous phenotypic range in genetic traits exists in soybean, which is well beyond the phenotypic range observed in the wild progenitor (Glycine soja Seib. et Zucc.). Maturity date, seed coat color, plant height, seed size, and seed yield are noted examples of traits which have a wider phenotypic range in G. max than in the wild G. soja. The diversity found in domesticated soybean is the result of over 3,000 years of cultivation in which Chinese farmers selected more than 20,000 landraces (defined as cultivars that predate scientific breeding). The extensive range in phenotype embodied in landraces today is the result of the slow spread of soybean throughout geographically diverse Asia (China first, then Korea and Japan), the continual occurrence of natural mutations in the crop, and both conscious and unconscious selection for local adaptation. The more recent spread of soybean out of Asia in the past 250 years, coupled with modern breeding efforts of the past 70, has intensified and globalized the process of local adaptation and increased the phenotypic range in soybean beyond that of landraces. The increased range in phenotype for modern cultivars includes increases in seed yield, elevation of seed protein/oil concentration, and development, only within the past 20 years, of commercial cultivars that are sufficiently tall and adapted to be grown profitably near the equator. The phenotypic range and distribution observed in modern cultivars and antecedent landraces have clear biogeographical interpretations which relate primarily to genetic alteration of photoperiod response (a prerequisite to adaptation to diverse latitudes) and tolerance to climate extremes.},

  abstract = {Soybean is an important cash crop with unique and important traits such as the high seed protein and oil contents, and the ability to perform symbiotic nitrogen fixation. A reference genome of cultivated soybeans was established in 2010, followed by whole-genome re-sequencing of wild and cultivated soybean accessions. These efforts revealed unique features of the soybean genome and helped to understand its evolution. Mapping of variations between wild and cultivated soybean genomes were performed. These genomic variations may be related to the process of domestication and human selection. Wild soybean germplasms exhibited high genomic diversity and hence may be an important source of novel genes/alleles. Accumulation of genomic data will help to refine genetic maps and expedite the identification of functional genes. In this review, we summarize the major findings from the whole-genome sequencing projects and discuss the possible impacts on soybean researches and breeding programs. Some emerging areas such as transcriptomic and epigenomic studies will be introduced. In addition, we also tabulated some useful bioinformatics tools that will help the mining of the soybean genomic data.},

However, we know surprisingly little about the extent and potential utility of the genetic variation found in wild relatives of maize. Here, we characterize a high-density genomic variation map from 744 genomes encompassing maize and all wild taxa of the genus Zea, identifying over 70 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The variation map reveals evidence of selection within taxa displaying novel adaptations. We focus on adaptive alleles in highland teosinte and temperate maize, highlighting the key role of flowering-time-related pathways in their adaptation. To show the utility of variants in these data, we generate mutant alleles for two flowering-time candidate genes. This work provides an extensive sampling of the genetic diversity of Zea, resolving questions on evolution and identifying adaptive variants for direct use in modern breeding.},

  abstract = {Selective sweeps can increase genetic differentiation among populations and cause allele frequency spectra to depart from the expectation under neutrality. We present a likelihood method for detecting selective sweeps that involves jointly modeling the multilocus allele frequency differentiation between two populations. We use Brownian motion to model genetic drift under neutrality, and a deterministic model to approximate the effect of a selective sweep on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity. We test the method with extensive simulated data, and demonstrate that in some scenarios the method provides higher power than previously reported approaches to detect selective sweeps, and can provide surprisingly good localization of the position of a selected allele. A strength of our technique is that it uses allele frequency differentiation between populations, which is much more robust to ascertainment bias in SNP discovery than methods based on the allele frequency spectrum. We apply this method to compare continentally diverse populations, as well as Northern and Southern Europeans. Our analysis identifies a list of loci as candidate targets of selection, including well-known selected loci and new regions that have not been highlighted by previous scans for selection.},

  abstract = {While photoperiod responses have been studied in soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] isolines, identification of temperature and photothermal responses are lacking in early-maturing soybean. This study was conducted to quantify photoperiod and temperature responses of early-maturing soybean. Six 'Harosoy' isolines with different combinations of alleles at the E1, E3, E4, and E7 loci were grown in growth cabinets with 10-, 12-, 14-, 16-, and 20-h photoperiods and with either 18 or 28 degreesC constant temperature. Under the most inductive conditions (10 and 12 h, 28 degreesC, all isolines flowered in about 26 d. Under the least inductive conditions (20 h, 28 degreesC, there was a 50 d difference in flowering time between the early- and late-flowering isolines. Interestingly, the late-flowering isolines flowered earlier under cool than under warm temperatures. A mathematical model was developed to quantify the effects of temperature and photoperiod on days to first flower. This model related the rate of phenological development from planting to flowering to temperature, photoperiod and the interaction between temperature and photoperiod. The equation was integrated analytically, resulting in an inverse time (1/time) equation, or numerically resulting in the development of a Growing Photothermal Day (G(PTD)) similar to a heat unit. The model had a base temperature (5.8 degreesC below which the rate of phenological development was zero, a critical or base photoperiod (13.5 h) below which photoperiod had no effect, and two genetic coefficients, one of which varied with isoline. The isoline photoperiod sensitivity coefficient was linearly related to the number of dominant (late flowering, photoperiod sensitive) alleles. The model fit the observed data well (R-2 = 0.96).},

The objectives of this work were to quantify cold tolerance of six potential parents, to screen breeding populations for cold tolerance, to search for associations between molecular markers and cold tolerance phenotypes, and to evaluate field performance of breeding lines. Six cultivars were evaluated for pod and seed set after exposure to 0 to 6 wk cold periods (15/5\textdegree C day/night), which began at flowering in growth cabinets. Evaluation at 6 vs. 2 wk following the end of a 3 or 6 wk cold period best discriminated between cold tolerant (CT) and cold sensitive (CS) cultivars. Two recombinant inbred line populations were cold stressed in growth cabinets with divergent selection performed over the F5 through F7 generations to select CT and CS lines. Bulked segregant analysis identified six chromosomal regions, four of which are related by homology, as potentially impacting the trait. Over 8 yr in the field at Ottawa, Canada, CT lines yielded 379 kg ha-1 more but matured 5.5 d later than CS lines without visual symptoms of cold damage. Following selection for early maturity, random lines from an additional four populations developed from a selected CT and CS line each crossed to another CT and CS parent were field tested in three environments. Cold tolerant \texttimes{} CT lines yielded about 8\% more than CS \texttimes{} CS lines, again without visual cold damage symptoms.},

Protein, oil, sugars, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium content was higher in the soymilks (d.b.) than in the original beans while calcium content was lower. Loss of solids from the beans during soaking was related to amount of water absorbed. Fatty acid analysis of the extracted fat revealed that 18:3 was negatively correlated with 18:1. All soybeans produced tofu of good texture. Composition of soymilk containing 6.25\% total solids was compared with that of bovine and human milk. Soymilk was low in fat and mono to tetra saccharides but contained large amounts of carbohydrates of higher molecular weight probably consisting of pectin and gums.

  abstract = {Soybean is a crop in high demand, in particular as a crucial source of plant protein. As a short-day plant, soybean is sensitive to the latitude of the growing site. Consequently, varieties that are well adapted to higher latitudes are required to expand the cultivation. In this study, we employed 50 soybean genotypes to perform a multi-location trial at seven locations across Germany in 2021. Two environmental target regions were determined following the latitude of the locations. Adaptation and trait stability of seed yield and protein content across all locations were evaluated using Genotype plus Genotype-by-Environment (GGE) biplots and Shukla's stability variance. We found a moderate level of crossing-over type genotype-by-location interaction across all locations. Within the environmental target regions, the genotype-by-location interaction could be minimised. Despite the positive correlation (R = 0.59) of seed yield between the environmental target regions and the same best-performing genotype, the genotype rankings differed in part substantially. In conclusion, we found that soybean can be grown at a wide range of latitudes across Germany. However, the performance of genotypes differed between the northern and southern locations, with an 18.8\% higher mean yield in the south. This in combination with the observed rank changes of high-performing genotypes between both environmental target regions suggests that selection targeted towards environments in northern Germany could improve soybean breeding for those higher latitude regions.},

  abstract = {Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate analysis that reduces the complexity of datasets while preserving data covariance. The outcome can be visualized on colorful scatterplots, ideally with only a minimal loss of information. PCA applications, implemented in well-cited packages like EIGENSOFT and PLINK, are extensively used as the foremost analyses in population genetics and related fields (e.g., animal and plant or medical genetics). PCA outcomes are used to shape study design, identify, and characterize individuals and populations, and draw historical and ethnobiological conclusions on origins, evolution, dispersion, and relatedness. The replicability crisis in science has prompted us to evaluate whether PCA results are reliable, robust, and replicable. We analyzed twelve common test cases using an intuitive color-based model alongside human population data. We demonstrate that PCA results can be artifacts of the data and can be easily manipulated to generate desired outcomes. PCA adjustment also yielded unfavorable outcomes in association studies. PCA results may not be reliable, robust, or replicable as the field assumes. Our findings raise concerns about the validity of results reported in the population genetics literature and related fields that place a disproportionate reliance upon PCA outcomes and the insights derived from them. We conclude that PCA may have a biasing role in genetic investigations and that 32,000-216,000 genetic studies should be reevaluated. An alternative mixed-admixture population genetic model is discussed.},

  abstract = {The genetic relatedness of North American soybean [Glycine max (L.) (Merr.)] may threaten long-term breeding progress. To alleviate this problem, we propose that breeders diversify applied programs by capitalizing upon genetic patterns that may exist in cultivated germplasm. To date, only one diversity pattern, the well-known North-South distinction, is explained in applied breeding. Our objective was to identify and quantify additional factors influencing diversity in 258 cultivars released by public agencies during 1945 to 1988. We theorized that maturity group effects (MG, as a hybridization restriction factor), location of breeding programs (BP, as a selection factor), and breeder intuition and success factors beyond MG and BP may all influence the soybean cultivar diversity patterns. The patterns of diversity associated with the first two factors, MG and BP, were examined by quantifying average coefficient of parentage (r) within and between MG and BP. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was applied to the r matrix to produce coordinates for pictorial depiction of MG and BP. To examine the third factor, breeder intuition and success, the MDS coordinates were also subjected to a nonhierarchical cluster analysis that revealed nine major clusters of soybean cultivars. A regression analysis was employed to determine the relative importance of North-South, MG, BP, and cluster patterns in explaining variation in the r matrix. The South-North distinction accounted for only 21\% of variability in cultivar relations indicating the presence of other major patterns of diversity. The MG, BP, and clusters independently explained 32, 42, and 57\% of the total variation in the cultivar pedigrees. Clusters most efficiently revealed patterns of diversity, and we propose the use of these clusters in the further study and management of soybean diversity. Multidimensional scaling coupled with nonhierarchical cluster analysis was a highly promising approach to the study of diversity.},

The EAA content and AA composition of the dietary protein source contribute to the differential muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of different proteins. Lower EAA contents and specific lack of sufficient leucine, lysine, and/or methionine may be responsible for the lower anabolic capacity of plant-based compared with animal-based proteins. We compared EAA contents and AA composition of a large selection of plant-based protein sources with animal-based proteins and human skeletal muscle protein. AA composition of oat, lupin, wheat, hemp, microalgae, soy, brown rice, pea, corn, potato, milk, whey, caseinate, casein, egg, and human skeletal muscle protein were assessed using UPLC\textendash MS/MS. EAA contents of plant-based protein isolates such as oat (21\%), lupin (21\%), and wheat (22\%) were lower than animal-based proteins (whey 43\%, milk 39\%, casein 34\%, and egg 32\%) and muscle protein (38\%). AA profiles largely differed among plant-based proteins with leucine contents ranging from 5.1\% for hemp to 13.5\% for corn protein, compared to 9.0\% for milk, 7.0\% for egg, and 7.6\% for muscle protein. Methionine and lysine were typically lower in plant-based proteins (1.0\,{$\pm$}\,0.3 and 3.6\,{$\pm$}\,0.6\%) compared with animal-based proteins (2.5\,{$\pm$}\,0.1 and 7.0\,{$\pm$}\,0.6\%) and muscle protein (2.0 and 7.8\%, respectively). In conclusion, there are large differences in EAA contents and AA composition between various plant-based protein isolates. Combinations of various plant-based protein isolates or blends of animal and plant-based proteins can provide protein characteristics that closely reflect the typical characteristics of animal-based proteins.},

FD soybean originated in China, although the details of its domestication history remain obscure. More than 500 diverse soybean accessions were sequenced using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) to address fundamental questions regarding soybean domestication. In total, 64 141 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) {$>$} 0.05 were found among the 512 tested accessions. The results indicated that the SD group is not a hybrid between the FD and ND groups. The initial domestication region was pinpointed to central China (demarcated by the Great Wall to the north and the Qinling Mountains to the south). A total of 800 highly differentiated genetic regions and {$>$} 140 selective sweeps were identified, and these were three- and twofold more likely, respectively, to encompass a known quantitative trait locus (QTL) than the rest of the soybean genome. Forty-three potential quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs; including 15 distinct traits) were identified by genome-wide association mapping. The results of the present study should be beneficial for soybean improvement and provide insight into the genetic architecture of traits of agronomic importance.},

Genebanks provide genetic variation for the improvement of modern varieties, but the selection of suitable germplasm is frequently impeded by incomplete phenotypic data. We address this bottleneck by combining a Focused Identification of Germplasm Strategy (FIGS) with core collection methodology to select soybean (Glycine max) germplasm for Central European breeding from a collection of {$>$}17,000 accessions. By focussing on adaptation to high-latitude cold regions, we selected an ``environmental precore'' of 3,663 accessions using environmental data and compared the Donor opulation of Environments (DPE) in Asia and the Target Population of Environments (TPE) in Central Europe in the present and 2070. Using single nucleotide polymorphisms, we reduced the precore into two diverse core collections of 183 and 366 accessions to serve as diversity panels for evaluation in the TPE. Genetic differentiation between precore and non-precore accessions revealed genomic regions that control maturity, and novel candidate loci for environmental adaptation, demonstrating the potential of diversity panels for studying adaptation. Objective-driven core collections have the potential to increase germplasm utilization for abiotic adaptation by breeding for a rapidly changing climate, or de novo adaptation of crops to expand cultivation ranges.},

  abstract = {Genomic structures of crops have changed considerably through its domestication and evolutionary processes. Present day cultivated varieties are the outcomes of constant natural hybridization, artificial selection, conventional breeding or genetic manipulation of their wild ancestors. Origin of a crop and its domestication pathways can be traced back by genomic characterization from the available resources. With the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques and other potential genomic tools, these studies have become convenient too. Genetic mapping and population genetic studies are being aided by NGS assisted forward and reverse genetic approaches. Many of these advanced methods have also been endorsed to unravel the origin trajectory of important crop species like\textemdash rice, citrus, peanut, olive, tea, etc. This chapter summarizes the various genomic tools and data analyses resources which are employed to dissect the complex genomes and underlying evolutionary steps as well as the paradigms of decoding domestication history of several crops.},

  abstract = {In a wide variety of organisms, Synonymous cottons are used with different frequencies, a phenomenon known as colon bias. Population genetic studies have shown that synonymous sites are under weak selection and that codon bias is maintained by a balance between selection, mutation, and genetic drift. It appears that the major Cause for selection oil codon bias is that certain preferred colons are translated more accurately and/or efficiently. However, additional and sometimes may be even contradictory selective forces appear to affect colon usage as well. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the ways ill which natural selection participates lit the creation and maintenance of codon bias. We also raise Several open questions: (i) IS natural selection weak independently of the level of codon bias? It is possible that selection for preferred Colons is weak only when colon bills approaches equilibrium and may be quite strong oil genes with colon bias levels that :ire much lower and/or above equilibrium. (ii) What determines the identity of the major colons? (iii) How do Shifts ill codon bias occur? (iv) What is the exact nature of selection oil colon bias? We discuss these questions in depth and offer some ideas on flow they can be addressed using a combination of computational and experimental analyses.},

  abstract = {Background With the migration of human beings, advances of agricultural sciences, evolution of planting patterns and global warming, soybeans have expanded to both tropical and high-latitude cold regions (HCRs). Unlike other regions, HCRs have much more significant and diverse photoperiods and temperature conditions over seasons or across latitudes, and HCR soybeans released there show rich diversity in maturity traits. However, HCR soybeans have not been as well classified into maturity groups (MGs) as other places. Therefore, it is necessary to identify MGs in HCRs and to genotype the maturity loci. Methods Local varieties were collected from the northern part of Northeast China and the far-eastern region of Russia. Maturity group reference (MGR) soybeans of MGs MG000, MG00, and MG0 were used as references during field experiments. Both local varieties and MGR soybeans were planted for two years (2010-2011) in Heihe (N 50\textdegree 15{${'}$}, E 127\textdegree 27{${'}$}, H 168.5 m), China. The days to VE (emergence), R1 (beginning bloom) and R7 (beginning maturity) were recorded and statistically analyzed. Furthermore, some varieties were further genotyped at four molecularly-identified maturity loci E1, E2, E3 and E4. Results The HCR varieties were classified into MG0 or even more early-maturing. In Heihe, some varieties matured much earlier than MG000, which is the most early-maturing known MG, and clustered into a separate group. We designated the group as MG0000, following the convention of MGs. HCR soybeans had relatively stable days to beginning bloom from emergence. The HCR varieties diversified into genotypes of E1, E2, E3 and E4. These loci had different effects on maturity. Conclusion HCRs diversify early-maturing MGs of soybean. MG0000, a new MG that matures much earlier than known MGs, was developed. HCR soybean breeding should focus more on shortening post-flowering reproductive growth. E1, E2, E3, and E4 function differentially.},

  abstract = {Soybean genome sequences were blasted with Arabidopsis thaliana regulatory genes involved in photoperiod-dependent flowering. This approach enabled the identification of 118 genes involved in the flowering pathway. Two genome sequences of cultivated (Williams 82) and wild (IT182932) soybeans were employed to survey functional DNA variations in the flowering-related homologs. Forty genes exhibiting nonsynonymous substitutions between G. max and G. soja were catalogued. In addition, 22 genes were found to co-localize with QTLs for six traits including flowering time, first flower, pod maturity, beginning of pod, reproductive period, and seed filling period. Among the genes overlapping the QTL regions, two LHY/CCA1 genes, GI and SFR6 contained amino acid changes. The recently duplicated sequence regions of the soybean genome were used as additional criteria for the speculation of the putative function of the homologs. Two duplicated regions showed redundancy of both flowering-related genes and QTLs. ID 12398025, which contains the homeologous regions between chr 7 and chr 16, was redundant for the LHY/CCA1 and SPA1 homologs and the QTLs. Retaining of the CRY1 gene and the pod maturity QTLs were observed in the duplicated region of ID 23546507 on chr 4 and chr 6. Functional DNA variation of the LHY/CCA1 gene (Glyma07g05410) was present in a counterpart of the duplicated region on chr 7, while the gene (Glyma16g01980) present in the other portion of the duplicated region on chr 16 did not show a functional sequence change. The gene list catalogued in this study provides primary insight for understanding the regulation of flowering time and maturity in soybean.},

In this review, many structural genomic differences between the two genomes are described and a total of 705 genes are identified as structural variations (SVs) between G. max and G. soja. After protein families database of alignments and hidden Markov models IDs and gene ontology terms were assigned, many interesting genes are discussed in detail using four domestication related traits, such as flowering time, transcriptional factors, carbon metabolism and disease resistance. Soybean domestication history is explored by studying these SVs in genes. Analysis of SVs in genes at the population-level may clarify the domestication history of soybean.},

  abstract = {There is a considerable demand for crop improvement, especially considering the increasing growth of world population, continuing climatic fluctuations, and rapidly evolving plant pests and pathogens. Crop wild relatives hold great potential in providing beneficial alleles for crop improvement. Wild soybean, Glycine soja (Siebold \& Zucc.), the wild ancestor to the domesticated soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), harbors a high level of genetic variation. Research on G. soja has been largely devoted to understanding the domestication history of the soybean, while little effort has been made to explore its genetic diversity for crop improvement. High genomic diversity and expanded traits make G. soja populations an excellent source for soybean improvement. This review summarizes recent successful research examples of applying wild soybeans in dissecting the genetic basis of various traits, with a focus on abiotic/biotic stress tolerance and resistance. We also discuss the limitations of using G. soja. Perspective future research is proposed, including the application of advanced biotechnology and emerging genomic data to further utilize the wild soybean to counterbalance the rising demand for superior crops. We proposed there is an urgent need for international collaboration on germplasm collection, resource sharing, and conservation. We hope to use the wild soybean as an example to promote the exploration and use of wild resources for crop improvement in order to meet future food requirements.},

In this large mega-environment (MEV) study, 75 European cultivars from five early maturity groups (MGs 000\textendash II) were evaluated for maturity-related traits at 22 locations in 10 countries across Europe. Clustering of the locations based on phenotypic similarity revealed six MEVs in latitudinal direction and suggested several more. Analysis of maturity identified several groups of cultivars with phenotypic similarity that are optimally adapted to the different growing regions in Europe. We identified several haplotypes for the allelic variants at the E1, E2, E3 and E4 genes, with each E haplotype comprising cultivars from different MGs. Cultivars with the same E haplotype can exhibit different flowering and maturity characteristics, suggesting that the genetic control of these traits is more complex and that adaptation involves additional genetic pathways, for example temperature requirement. Taken together, our study allowed the first unified assessment of soybean-growing regions in Europe and illustrates the strong effect of photoperiod on soybean adaptation and MEV classification, as well as the effects of the E maturity loci for soybean adaptation in Europe.},

However, pod setting ability during the low temperature exposure was higher in Hayahikari than in Toyomusume. After the short-term exposure to a low temperature, pod setting showed recovery from the cold-weather damage by compensative pod setting after the low temperature treatment in both varieties. The long-term exposure to a low temperature significantly decreased the total number of pods in Toyomusume. But Hayahikari showed a greater capacity for pod setting during the low temperature. And the mechanism of tolerance was related to a superior fertilization ability during the low temperature.},

  abstract = {The recently acquired archaeological record for soybean from Japan, China and Korea is shedding light on the context in which this important economic plant became associated with people and was domesticated. This paper examines archaeological (charred) soybean seed size variation to determine what insight can be gained from a comprehensive comparison of 949 specimens from 22 sites. Seed length alone appears to represent seed size change through time, although the length\texttimes width\texttimes thickness product has the potential to provide better size change resolution. A widespread early association of small seeded soybean is as old as 9000\textendash 8600 cal BP in northern China and 7000 cal BP in Japan. Direct AMS radiocarbon dates on charred soybean seeds indicate selection resulted in large seed sizes in Japan by 5000 cal BP (Middle Jomon) and in Korea by 3000 cal BP (Early Mumun). Soybean seeds recovered in China from the Shang through Han periods are similar in length to the large Korean and Japanese specimens, but the overall size of the large Middle and Late Jomon, Early Mumun through Three Kingdom seeds is significantly larger than any of the Chinese specimens. The archaeological record appears to disconfirm the hypothesis of a single domestication of soybean and supports the view informed by recent phyologenetic research that soybean was domesticated in several locations in East Asia.},

  abstract = {Agricultural production is greatly dependent on daylength, which is determined by latitude. Living organisms align their physiology to daylength through the circadian clock, which is made up of input sensors, core and peripheral clock components, and output. The light/dark cycle is the major input signal, moderated by temperature fluctuations and metabolic changes. The core clock in plants functions mainly through a number of transcription feedback loops. It is known that the circadian clock is not essential for survival. However, alterations in the clock components can lead to substantial changes in physiology. Thus, these clock components have become the de facto targets of artificial selection for crop improvement during domestication. Soybean was domesticated around 5,000 years ago. Although the circadian clock itself is not of particular interest to soybean breeders, specific alleles of the circadian clock components that affect agronomic traits, such as plant architecture, sensitivity to light/dark cycle, flowering time, maturation time, and yield, are. Consequently, compared to their wild relatives, cultivated soybeans have been bred to be more adaptive and productive at different latitudes and habitats for acreage expansion, even though the selection processes were made without any prior knowledge of the circadian clock. Now with the advances in comparative genomics, known modifications in the circadian clock component genes in cultivated soybean have been found, supporting the hypothesis that modifications of the clock are important for crop improvement. In this review, we will summarize the known modifications in soybean circadian clock components as a result of domestication and improvement. In addition to the well-studied effects on developmental timing, we will also discuss the potential of circadian clock modifications for improving other aspects of soybean productivity.},

  abstract = {Photoperiodic flowering is one of the most important factors affecting regional adaptation and yield in soybean (Glycine max). Plant adaptation to long-day conditions at higher latitudes requires early flowering and a reduction or loss of photoperiod sensitivity; adaptation to short-day conditions at lower latitudes involves delayed flowering, which prolongs vegetative growth for maximum yield potential. Due to the influence of numerous major loci and quantitative trait loci (QTLs), soybean has broad adaptability across latitudes. Forward genetic approaches have uncovered the molecular basis for several of these major maturity genes and QTLs. Moreover, the molecular characterization of orthologs of Arabidopsis thaliana flowering genes has enriched our understanding of the photoperiodic flowering pathway in soybean. Building on early insights into the importance of the photoreceptor phytochrome A, several circadian clock components have been integrated into the genetic network controlling flowering in soybean: E1, a repressor of FLOWERING LOCUS T orthologs, plays a central role in this network. Here, we provide an overview of recent progress in elucidating photoperiodic flowering in soybean, how it contributes to our fundamental understanding of flowering time control, and how this information could be used for molecular design and breeding of high-yielding soybean cultivars.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Understanding the genetic basis underlying domestication-related traits (DRTs) is important in order to use wild germplasm efficiently for improving yield, stress tolerance and quality of crops. This study was conducted to characterize the genetic basis of DRTs in soybean (Glycine max) using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Methods A population of 96 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cultivated (ssp. max) x wild (ssp. soja) cross was used for mapping and QTL analysis. Nine DRTs were examined in 2004 and 2005. A linkage map was constructed with 282 markers by the Kosambi function, and the QTL was detected by composite interval mapping. Key Results The early flowering and determinate habit derived from the max parent were each controlled by one major QTL, corresponding to the major genes for maturity (e1) and determinate habit (dt1), respectively. There were only one or two significant QTLs for twinning habit, pod dehiscence, seed weight and hard seededness, which each accounted for approx. 20-50\% of the total variance. A comparison with the QTLs detected previously indicated that in pod dehiscence and hard seededness, at least one major QTL was common across different crosses, whereas no such consistent QTL existed for seed weight. Conclusions Most of the DRTs in soybeans were conditioned by one or two major QTLs and a number of genotype-dependent minor QTLs. The common major QTLs identified in pod dehiscence and hard seededness may have been key loci in the domestication of soybean. The evolutionary changes toward larger seed may have occurred through the accumulation of minor changes at many QTLs. Since the major QTLs for DRTs were scattered across only six of the 20 linkage groups, and since the QTLs were not clustered, introgression of useful genes from wild to cultivated soybeans can be carried out without large obstacles.},

  abstract = {Principal components analysis, PCA, is a statistical method commonly used in population genetics to identify structure in the distribution of genetic variation across geographical location and ethnic background. However, while the method is often used to inform about historical demographic processes, little is known about the relationship between fundamental demographic parameters and the projection of samples onto the primary axes. Here I show that for SNP data the projection of samples onto the principal components can be obtained directly from considering the average coalescent times between pairs of haploid genomes. The result provides a framework for interpreting PCA projections in terms of underlying processes, including migration, geographical isolation, and admixture. I also demonstrate a link between PCA and Wright's fst and show that SNP ascertainment has a largely simple and predictable effect on the projection of samples. Using examples from human genetics, I discuss the application of these results to empirical data and the implications for inference., Genetic variation in natural populations typically demonstrates structure arising from diverse processes including geographical isolation, founder events, migration, and admixture. One technique commonly used to uncover such structure is principal components analysis, which identifies the primary axes of variation in data and projects the samples onto these axes in a graphically appealing and intuitive manner. However, as the method is non-parametric, it can be hard to relate PCA to underlying process. Here, I show that the underlying genealogical history of the samples can be related directly to the PC projection. The result is useful because it is straightforward to predict the effects of different demographic processes on the sample genealogy. However, the result also reveals the limitations of PCA, in that multiple processes can give the same projections, it is strongly influenced by uneven sampling, and it discards important information in the spatial structure of genetic variation along chromosomes.},

  abstract = {In many non-Asian countries, soy is consumed via soy-based meat and dairy alternatives, in addition to the traditional Asian soyfoods, such as tofu and miso. Meat alternatives are typically made using concentrated sources of soy protein, such as soy protein isolate (SPI) and soy protein concentrate (SPC). Therefore, these products are classified as ultra-processed foods (UPFs; group 4) according to NOVA, an increasingly widely used food-classification system that classifies all foods into 1 of 4 groups according to the processing they undergo. Furthermore, most soymilks, even those made from whole soybeans, are also classified as UPFs because of the addition of sugars and emulsifiers. Increasingly, recommendations are being made to restrict the consumption of UPFs because their intake is associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes. Critics of UPFs argue these foods are unhealthful for a wide assortment of reasons. Explanations for the proposed adverse effects of UPFs include their high energy density, high glycemic index (GI), hyper-palatability, and low satiety potential. Claims have also been made that UPFs are not sustainably produced. However, this perspective argues that none of the criticisms of UPFs apply to soy-based meat and dairy alternatives when compared with their animal-based counterparts, beef and cow milk, which are classified as unprocessed or minimally processed foods (group 1). Classifying soy-based meat and dairy alternatives as UPFs may hinder their public acceptance, which could detrimentally affect personal and planetary health. In conclusion, the NOVA classification system is simplistic and does not adequately evaluate the nutritional attributes of meat and dairy alternatives based on soy.},

The methods treated cover a large number of topics from traditional population genetics to large-scale genomics with high-throughput sequencing data. Several dozen R packages are examined and integrated to provide a coherent software environment with a wide range of computational, statistical, and graphical tools. Small examples are used to illustrate the basics and published data are used as case studies. Readers are expected to have a basic knowledge of biology, genetics, and statistical inference methods. Graduate students and post-doctorate researchers will find resources to analyze their population genetic and genomic data as well as help them design new studies. The first four chapters review the basics of population genomics, data acquisition, and the use of R to store and manipulate genomic data. Chapter 5 treats the exploration of genomic data, an important issue when analysing large data sets. The other five chapters cover linkage disequilibrium, population genomic structure, geographical structure, past demographic events, and natural selection. These chapters include supervised and unsupervised methods, admixture analysis, an in-depth treatment of multivariate methods, and advice on how to handle GIS data. The analysis of natural selection, a traditional issue in evolutionary biology, has known a revival with modern population genomic data. All chapters include exercises.

  abstract = {Many aspects of the historical relationships between populations in a species are reflected in genetic data. Inferring these relationships from genetic data, however, remains a challenging task. In this paper, we present a statistical model for inferring the patterns of population splits and mixtures in multiple populations. In our model, the sampled populations in a species are related to their common ancestor through a graph of ancestral populations. Using genome-wide allele frequency data and a Gaussian approximation to genetic drift, we infer the structure of this graph. We applied this method to a set of 55 human populations and a set of 82 dog breeds and wild canids. In both species, we show that a simple bifurcating tree does not fully describe the data; in contrast, we infer many migration events. While some of the migration events that we find have been detected previously, many have not. For example, in the human data, we infer that Cambodians trace approximately 16\% of their ancestry to a population ancestral to other extant East Asian populations. In the dog data, we infer that both the boxer and basenji trace a considerable fraction of their ancestry (9\% and 25\%, respectively) to wolves subsequent to domestication and that East Asian toy breeds (the Shih Tzu and the Pekingese) result from admixture between modern toy breeds and ``ancient'' Asian breeds. Software implementing the model described here, called TreeMix, is available at http://treemix.googlecode.com.},

  abstract = {Targeted and untargeted selections including domestication and breeding efforts can reduce genetic diversity in breeding germplasm and create selective sweeps in crop genomes. The genomic regions at which selective sweeps are detected can reveal important information about signatures of selection. We have analyzed the genetic diversity within a soybean germplasm collection relevant for breeding in Europe (the EUCLEG collection), and have identified selective sweeps through a genome-wide scan comparing that collection to Chinese soybean collections. This work involved genotyping of 480 EUCLEG soybean accessions, including 210 improved varieties, 216 breeding lines and 54 landraces using the 355K SoySNP microarray. SNP calling of 477 EUCLEG accessions together with 328 Chinese soybean accessions identified 224,993 high-quality SNP markers. Population structure analysis revealed a clear differentiation between the EUCLEG collection and the Chinese materials. Further, the EUCLEG collection was sub-structured into five subgroups that were differentiated by geographical origin. No clear association between subgroups and maturity group was detected. The genetic diversity was lower in the EUCLEG collection compared to the Chinese collections. Selective sweep analysis revealed 23 selective sweep regions distributed over 12 chromosomes. Co-localization of these selective sweep regions with previously reported QTLs and genes revealed that various signatures of selection in the EUCLEG collection may be related to domestication and improvement traits including seed protein and oil content, phenology, nitrogen fixation, yield components, diseases resistance and quality. No signatures of selection related to stem determinacy were detected. In addition, absence of signatures of selection for a substantial number of QTLs related to yield, protein content, oil content and phenological traits suggests the presence of substantial genetic diversity in the EUCLEG collection. Taken together, the results obtained demonstrate that the available genetic diversity in the EUCLEG collection can be further exploited for research and breeding purposes. However, incorporation of exotic material can be considered to broaden its genetic base.},

  abstract = {Datasets of hundreds or thousands of SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) from multiple individuals per species are increasingly used to study population structure, species delimitation and shallow phylogenetics. The principal software tool to infer species or population trees from SNP data is currently the BEAST template SNAPP which uses a Bayesian coalescent analysis. However, it is computationally extremely demanding and tolerates only small amounts of missing data. We used simulated and empirical SNPs from plants (Australian Craspedia, Asteraceae, and Pelargonium, Geraniaceae) to compare species trees produced (1) by SNAPP, (2) using SVD quartets, and (3) using Bayesian and parsimony analysis with several different approaches to summarising data from multiple samples into one set of traits per species. Our aims were to explore the impact of tree topology and missing data on the results, and to test which data summarising and analyses approaches would best approximate the results obtained from SNAPP for empirical data. SVD quartets retrieved the correct topology from simulated data, as did SNAPP except in the case of a very unbalanced phylogeny. Both methods failed to retrieve the correct topology when large amounts of data were missing. Bayesian analysis of species level summary data scoring the two alleles of each SNP as independent characters and parsimony analysis of data scoring each SNP as one character produced trees with branch length distributions closest to the true trees on which SNPs were simulated. For empirical data, Bayesian inference and Dollo parsimony analysis of data scored allele-wise produced phylogenies most congruent with the results of SNAPP. In the case of study groups divergent enough for missing data to be phylogenetically informative (because of additional mutations preventing amplification of genomic fragments or bioinformatic establishment of homology), scoring of SNP data as a presence/absence matrix irrespective of allele content might be an additional option. As this depends on sampling across species being reasonably even and a random distribution of non-informative instances of missing data, however, further exploration of this approach is needed. Properly chosen data summary approaches to inferring species trees from SNP data may represent a potential alternative to currently available individual-level coalescent analyses especially for quick data exploration and when dealing with computationally demanding or patchy datasets.},

However, there is still no universal standard or quantifiable methodology for MG classification. In this study, phenological traits of 107 Chinese, 4 Far East Russian representative soybean varieties, and 113 North American reference varieties covering 13 MGs were evaluated at eight locations (ranging from 30 to 50\textdegree{} N) in four ecoregions of China for two consecutive years (2014 and 2015). Relative maturity groups (RMGs) were attributed to all the varieties based on the linear regression models. To decimalize the RMG values of the early-maturing varieties belonging to MGs below 0, negative values were defined for MGs 00, 000, and 0000. The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model was used to screen 185 standard candidate varieties for MGs 0000 to VIII. This study provided a systematic and quantifiable methodology for RMG identification in soybeans. The methodology is expected to be widely adopted by soybean regionalization and germplasm exchanges throughout the world and will be helpful for characterizing the photothermal sensitivity and adaptability of the given soybean varieties.},

  abstract = {Crop domestication is a good example of plant\textendash human co-evolution. Seed gathering and human cultivation of crops were observed since the Neolithic period, as shown by archeological evidence. Numerous studies have been conducted to identify genes related to domestication. With the development of molecular techniques (molecular markers and next-generation sequencing) and bioinformatics, a greater understanding of crop domestication and improvement has been established, including the origins of crops, the numbers of independent domestication events, the molecular diversity of domestication-related traits (DRTs), and the selection pressures. A comparison of the genome sequences between wild species and cultivated crops may provide key information regarding the genetic elements involved in speciation and domestication. Therefore, sequencing projects of currently important crops and their wild relatives are in progress. Accordingly, whole genome sequencing of soybean could provide new knowledge about domestication of this important crop. In this review, we introduce the archaeological evidence of soybean domestication and summarize the DRTs in soybean populations of crosses between cultivated (Glycine max) and wild soybean (G. soja). Soybean domestication is discussed at the sequence level. The current hypothesis of soybean domestication considers that G. max was domesticated from G. soja. However, our previous work suggested that soybean was domesticated from the G. soja/G. max complex that diverged from a common ancestor of these two species of Glycine. This review explores soybean domestication history by focusing on nucleotide diversity using resequencing. Analysis of genes around DRTs at the population level may clarify the domestication history of soybean.},

Germplasm studies enable plant breeders to incorporate novel genetic resources into breeding pipelines to improve valuable agronomic traits. We conducted comprehensive analyses on the 19,652 soybean accessions in the USDA-ARS germplasm collection, genotyped with the SoySNP50 K iSelect BeadChip SNP array, to elucidate the quantitative properties of existing subpopulations inferred through hierarchical clustering performed with Ward's D agglomeration method and Nei's standard genetic distance. We found the effective population size to be approximately 106 individuals based on the linkage disequilibrium of unlinked loci. The cladogram indicated the existence of eight major clusters. Each cluster displays particular properties with regard to major quantitative traits. Among those, cluster 3 represents the tropical and semi-tropical genetic material, cluster 5 displays large seeds and may represent food-grade germplasm, and cluster 7 represents the undomesticated material in the germplasm collection. The average F-ST among clusters was 0.22 and a total of 914 SNPs were exclusive to specific clusters. Our classification and characterization of the germplasm collection into major clusters provides valuable information about the genetic resources available to soybean breeders and researchers.},

  abstract = {Genomic prediction with imputed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data is an attractive approach to improve predictive ability with low cost. However, high accuracy has not been realized using this method in livestock. In this study, we imputed 435 individuals from 600K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip data to WGS data using different reference panels. We also investigated the prediction accuracy of genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) using imputed WGS data from different reference panels, linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker pruning, and pre-selected variants based on Genome-wide association society (GWAS) results. Results showed that the imputation accuracies from 600K to WGS data were 0.873 {$\pm$} 0.038, 0.906 {$\pm$} 0.036, and 0.979 {$\pm$} 0.010 for the internal, external, and combined reference panels, respectively. In most traits of chickens, the prediction accuracy of imputed WGS data obtained from the internal reference panel was greater than or equal to that of the combined reference panel; the external reference panel had the lowest prediction accuracy. Compared with 600K chip data, GBLUP with imputed WGS data had only a small increase (1\textendash 3\%) in prediction accuracy. Using only variants selected from imputed WGS data based on GWAS results resulted in almost no increase for most traits and even increased the bias of the regression coefficient. The impact of the degree of LD of selected and remaining variants on prediction accuracy was different. For average daily gain (ADG), residual feed intake (RFI), intestine length (IL), and body weight in 91 days (BW91), the accuracy of GBLUP increased as the degree of LD of selected variants decreased, but the opposite relationship occurred for the remaining variants. But for breast muscle weight (BMW) and average daily feed intake (ADFI), the accuracy of GBLUP increased as the degree of LD of selected variants increased, and the degree of LD of remaining variants had a small effect on prediction accuracy. Overall, the optimal imputation strategy to obtain WGS data for genomic prediction should consider the relationship between selected individuals and target population individuals to avoid heterogeneity of imputation. LD-based marker pruning can be used to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction using imputed WGS data.},

  abstract = {Soybean (Glycine max) is a facultative short-day plant with a sensitive photoperiod perception and reaction system, which allows it to adjust its physiological state and gene regulatory networks to seasonal and diurnal changes in environmental conditions. In the past few decades, soybean cultivation has spread from East Asia to areas throughout the world. Biologists and breeders must now confront the challenge of understanding the molecular mechanism of soybean photoperiodism and improving agronomic traits to enable this important crop to adapt to geographical and environmental changes. In this review, we summarize the genetic regulatory network underlying photoperiodic responses in soybean. Genomic and genetic studies have revealed that the circadian clock, in conjunction with the light perception pathways, regulates photoperiodic flowering. Here, we provide an annotated list of 844 candidate flowering genes in soybean, with their putative biological functions. Many photoperiod-related genes have been intensively selected during domestication and crop improvement. Finally, we describe recent progress in engineering photoperiod-responsive genes for improving agronomic traits to enhance geographic adaptation in soybean, as well as future prospects for research on soybean photoperiodic responses.},

  abstract = {To address domestication and improvement studies of soybean seed size- and oil-related traits, a series of domesticated and improved regions, loci, and candidate genes were identified in 286 soybean accessions using domestication and improvement analyses, genome-wide association studies, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and bulked segregant analyses in this study. As a result, 534 candidate domestication regions (CDRs) and 458 candidate improvement regions (CIRs) were identified in this study and integrated with those in five and three previous studies, respectively, to obtain 952 CDRs and 538 CIRs; 1469 loci for soybean seed size- and oil-related traits were identified in this study and integrated with those in Soybase to obtain 433 QTL clusters. The two results were intersected to obtain 245 domestication and 221 improvement loci for the above traits. Around these trait-related domestication and improvement loci, 7 domestication and 7 improvement genes were found to be truly associated with these traits, and 372 candidate domestication and 87 candidate improvement genes were identified using gene expression, SNP variants in genome, miRNA binding, KEGG pathway, DNA methylation, and haplotype analysis. These genes were used to explain the trait changes in domestication and improvement. As a result, the trait changes can be explained by their frequencies of elite haplotypes, base mutations in coding region, and three factors affecting their expression levels. In addition, 56 domestication and 15 improvement genes may be valuable for future soybean breeding. This study can provide useful gene resources for future soybean breeding and molecular biology research.},
