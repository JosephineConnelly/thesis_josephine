  abstract = {Plants of eight isolines of soyabean [Glycine max (L,.) Merrill], comprising all combinations of two alleles at the three loci E-1/e(1), E-2/e(2) and E-3/e(3) in the cultivar 'Clark' background, were transferred after different periods following first flowering from long days (LD, 14 h d(-1)) to short days (SD, 12 h d(-1)) and vice versa in a reciprocal-transfer experiment in a plastic house maintained at 30/24 degrees C (day/night). Photoperiod (0.10 \textquestiondown{} P \textexclamdown{} 0.05), transfer time (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001), isoline (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001), and their interactions (P \textexclamdown{} 0.001) all affected flowering duration, i.e. the period from first flowering until the appearance of the last flower. The flowering duration comprised two distinct phases: a photoperiod-sensitive phase beginning at first flowering, and a subsequent photoperiod-insensitive phase. The duration of the photoperiod-sensitive phase varied much more among the isolines in LH) than in SD. Only the dominant allele E-1 increased the sensitivity of the photoperiod-sensitive phase of flowering duration to photoperiod singly, but positive epistatic effects were detected between E-1 and E-2, E-1 and E-3, and especially among all three dominant alleles. The increases in flowering duration resulting from the combined effects of gene and environment (i.e. photoperiod) were associated with considerable increases in biomass and seed yield at harvest maturity.

  abstract = {It is the purpose of this paper to illustrate the impact of geography, climate, and humankind in shaping the present-day genetic diversity in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Examination of soybean germplasm collections around the globe reveals that an enormous phenotypic range in genetic traits exists in soybean, which is well beyond the phenotypic range observed in the wild progenitor (Glycine soja Seib. et Zucc.). Maturity date, seed coat color, plant height, seed size, and seed yield are noted examples of traits which have a wider phenotypic range in G. max than in the wild G. soja. The diversity found in domesticated soybean is the result of over 3,000 years of cultivation in which Chinese farmers selected more than 20,000 landraces (defined as cultivars that predate scientific breeding). The extensive range in phenotype embodied in landraces today is the result of the slow spread of soybean throughout geographically diverse Asia (China first, then Korea and Japan), the continual occurrence of natural mutations in the crop, and both conscious and unconscious selection for local adaptation. The more recent spread of soybean out of Asia in the past 250 years, coupled with modern breeding efforts of the past 70, has intensified and globalized the process of local adaptation and increased the phenotypic range in soybean beyond that of landraces. The increased range in phenotype for modern cultivars includes increases in seed yield, elevation of seed protein/oil concentration, and development, only within the past 20 years, of commercial cultivars that are sufficiently tall and adapted to be grown profitably near the equator. The phenotypic range and distribution observed in modern cultivars and antecedent landraces have clear biogeographical interpretations which relate primarily to genetic alteration of photoperiod response (a prerequisite to adaptation to diverse latitudes) and tolerance to climate extremes.},

  abstract = {Soybean is an important cash crop with unique and important traits such as the high seed protein and oil contents, and the ability to perform symbiotic nitrogen fixation. A reference genome of cultivated soybeans was established in 2010, followed by whole-genome re-sequencing of wild and cultivated soybean accessions. These efforts revealed unique features of the soybean genome and helped to understand its evolution. Mapping of variations between wild and cultivated soybean genomes were performed. These genomic variations may be related to the process of domestication and human selection. Wild soybean germplasms exhibited high genomic diversity and hence may be an important source of novel genes/alleles. Accumulation of genomic data will help to refine genetic maps and expedite the identification of functional genes. In this review, we summarize the major findings from the whole-genome sequencing projects and discuss the possible impacts on soybean researches and breeding programs. Some emerging areas such as transcriptomic and epigenomic studies will be introduced. In addition, we also tabulated some useful bioinformatics tools that will help the mining of the soybean genomic data.},

  abstract = {Maize is a globally valuable commodity and one of the most extensively studied genetic model organisms. However, we know surprisingly little about the extent and potential utility of the genetic variation found in wild relatives of maize. Here, we characterize a high-density genomic variation map from 744 genomes encompassing maize and all wild taxa of the genus Zea, identifying over 70 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The variation map reveals evidence of selection within taxa displaying novel adaptations. We focus on adaptive alleles in highland teosinte and temperate maize, highlighting the key role of flowering-time-related pathways in their adaptation. To show the utility of variants in these data, we generate mutant alleles for two flowering-time candidate genes. This work provides an extensive sampling of the genetic diversity of Zea, resolving questions on evolution and identifying adaptive variants for direct use in modern breeding.},

  abstract = {While photoperiod responses have been studied in soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] isolines, identification of temperature and photothermal responses are lacking in early-maturing soybean. This study was conducted to quantify photoperiod and temperature responses of early-maturing soybean. Six 'Harosoy' isolines with different combinations of alleles at the E1, E3, E4, and E7 loci were grown in growth cabinets with 10-, 12-, 14-, 16-, and 20-h photoperiods and with either 18 or 28 degreesC constant temperature. Under the most inductive conditions (10 and 12 h, 28 degreesC, all isolines flowered in about 26 d. Under the least inductive conditions (20 h, 28 degreesC, there was a 50 d difference in flowering time between the early- and late-flowering isolines. Interestingly, the late-flowering isolines flowered earlier under cool than under warm temperatures. A mathematical model was developed to quantify the effects of temperature and photoperiod on days to first flower. This model related the rate of phenological development from planting to flowering to temperature, photoperiod and the interaction between temperature and photoperiod. The equation was integrated analytically, resulting in an inverse time (1/time) equation, or numerically resulting in the development of a Growing Photothermal Day (G(PTD)) similar to a heat unit. The model had a base temperature (5.8 degreesC below which the rate of phenological development was zero, a critical or base photoperiod (13.5 h) below which photoperiod had no effect, and two genetic coefficients, one of which varied with isoline. The isoline photoperiod sensitivity coefficient was linearly related to the number of dominant (late flowering, photoperiod sensitive) alleles. The model fit the observed data well (R-2 = 0.96).},

  abstract = {Cold temperatures during early reproductive development may result in reduced pod and seed formation in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. The objectives of this work were to quantify cold tolerance of six potential parents, to screen breeding populations for cold tolerance, to search for associations between molecular markers and cold tolerance phenotypes, and to evaluate field performance of breeding lines. Six cultivars were evaluated for pod and seed set after exposure to 0 to 6 wk cold periods (15/5\textdegree C day/night), which began at flowering in growth cabinets. Evaluation at 6 vs. 2 wk following the end of a 3 or 6 wk cold period best discriminated between cold tolerant (CT) and cold sensitive (CS) cultivars. Two recombinant inbred line populations were cold stressed in growth cabinets with divergent selection performed over the F5 through F7 generations to select CT and CS lines. Bulked segregant analysis identified six chromosomal regions, four of which are related by homology, as potentially impacting the trait. Over 8 yr in the field at Ottawa, Canada, CT lines yielded 379 kg ha-1 more but matured 5.5 d later than CS lines without visual symptoms of cold damage. Following selection for early maturity, random lines from an additional four populations developed from a selected CT and CS line each crossed to another CT and CS parent were field tested in three environments. Cold tolerant \texttimes{} CT lines yielded about 8\% more than CS \texttimes{} CS lines, again without visual cold damage symptoms.},

  abstract = {Present-day soybeans consist of elite cultivars and landraces (Glycine max, fully domesticated (FD)), annual wild type (Glycine soja, nondomesticated (ND)), and semi-wild type (semi-domesticated (SD)). FD soybean originated in China, although the details of its domestication history remain obscure. More than 500 diverse soybean accessions were sequenced using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) to address fundamental questions regarding soybean domestication. In total, 64 141 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) {$>$} 0.05 were found among the 512 tested accessions. The results indicated that the SD group is not a hybrid between the FD and ND groups. The initial domestication region was pinpointed to central China (demarcated by the Great Wall to the north and the Qinling Mountains to the south). A total of 800 highly differentiated genetic regions and {$>$} 140 selective sweeps were identified, and these were three- and twofold more likely, respectively, to encompass a known quantitative trait locus (QTL) than the rest of the soybean genome. Forty-three potential quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs; including 15 distinct traits) were identified by genome-wide association mapping. The results of the present study should be beneficial for soybean improvement and provide insight into the genetic architecture of traits of agronomic importance.},

  abstract = {In a wide variety of organisms, Synonymous cottons are used with different frequencies, a phenomenon known as colon bias. Population genetic studies have shown that synonymous sites are under weak selection and that codon bias is maintained by a balance between selection, mutation, and genetic drift. It appears that the major Cause for selection oil codon bias is that certain preferred colons are translated more accurately and/or efficiently. However, additional and sometimes may be even contradictory selective forces appear to affect colon usage as well. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the ways ill which natural selection participates lit the creation and maintenance of codon bias. We also raise Several open questions: (i) IS natural selection weak independently of the level of codon bias? It is possible that selection for preferred Colons is weak only when colon bills approaches equilibrium and may be quite strong oil genes with colon bias levels that :ire much lower and/or above equilibrium. (ii) What determines the identity of the major colons? (iii) How do Shifts ill codon bias occur? (iv) What is the exact nature of selection oil colon bias? We discuss these questions in depth and offer some ideas on flow they can be addressed using a combination of computational and experimental analyses.},

  abstract = {Soybean genome sequences were blasted with Arabidopsis thaliana regulatory genes involved in photoperiod-dependent flowering. This approach enabled the identification of 118 genes involved in the flowering pathway. Two genome sequences of cultivated (Williams 82) and wild (IT182932) soybeans were employed to survey functional DNA variations in the flowering-related homologs. Forty genes exhibiting nonsynonymous substitutions between G. max and G. soja were catalogued. In addition, 22 genes were found to co-localize with QTLs for six traits including flowering time, first flower, pod maturity, beginning of pod, reproductive period, and seed filling period. Among the genes overlapping the QTL regions, two LHY/CCA1 genes, GI and SFR6 contained amino acid changes. The recently duplicated sequence regions of the soybean genome were used as additional criteria for the speculation of the putative function of the homologs. Two duplicated regions showed redundancy of both flowering-related genes and QTLs. ID 12398025, which contains the homeologous regions between chr 7 and chr 16, was redundant for the LHY/CCA1 and SPA1 homologs and the QTLs. Retaining of the CRY1 gene and the pod maturity QTLs were observed in the duplicated region of ID 23546507 on chr 4 and chr 6. Functional DNA variation of the LHY/CCA1 gene (Glyma07g05410) was present in a counterpart of the duplicated region on chr 7, while the gene (Glyma16g01980) present in the other portion of the duplicated region on chr 16 did not show a functional sequence change. The gene list catalogued in this study provides primary insight for understanding the regulation of flowering time and maturity in soybean.},

  abstract = {Since the genome sequences of wild species may provide key information about the genetic elements involved in speciation and domestication, the undomesticated soybean (Glycine soja Sieb. and Zucc.), a wild relative of the current cultivated soybean (G. max), was sequenced. In contrast to the current hypothesis of soybean domestication, which holds that the current cultivated soybean was domesticated from G. soja, our previous work has suggested that soybean was domesticated from the G. soja/G. max complex that diverged from a common ancestor of these two species of Glycine. In this review, many structural genomic differences between the two genomes are described and a total of 705 genes are identified as structural variations (SVs) between G. max and G. soja. After protein families database of alignments and hidden Markov models IDs and gene ontology terms were assigned, many interesting genes are discussed in detail using four domestication related traits, such as flowering time, transcriptional factors, carbon metabolism and disease resistance. Soybean domestication history is explored by studying these SVs in genes. Analysis of SVs in genes at the population-level may clarify the domestication history of soybean.},

The long-term exposure to a low temperature significantly decreased the total number of pods in Toyomusume. But Hayahikari showed a greater capacity for pod setting during the low temperature.

This paper examines archaeological (charred) soybean seed size variation to determine what insight can be gained from a comprehensive comparison of 949 specimens from 22 sites. Seed length alone appears to represent seed size change through time, although the length\texttimes width\texttimes thickness product has the potential to provide better size change resolution. A widespread early association of small seeded soybean is as old as 9000\textendash 8600 cal BP in northern China and 7000 cal BP in Japan. Direct AMS radiocarbon dates on charred soybean seeds indicate selection resulted in large seed sizes in Japan by 5000 cal BP (Middle Jomon) and in Korea by 3000 cal BP (Early Mumun). Soybean seeds recovered in China from the Shang through Han periods are similar in length to the large Korean and Japanese specimens, but the overall size of the large Middle and Late Jomon, Early Mumun through Three Kingdom seeds is significantly larger than any of the Chinese specimens. The archaeological record appears to disconfirm the hypothesis of a single domestication of soybean and supports the view informed by recent phyologenetic research that soybean was domesticated in several locations in East Asia.},

  abstract = {Photoperiodic flowering is one of the most important factors affecting regional adaptation and yield in soybean (Glycine max). Plant adaptation to long-day conditions at higher latitudes requires early flowering and a reduction or loss of photoperiod sensitivity; adaptation to short-day conditions at lower latitudes involves delayed flowering, which prolongs vegetative growth for maximum yield potential. Due to the influence of numerous major loci and quantitative trait loci (QTLs), soybean has broad adaptability across latitudes. Forward genetic approaches have uncovered the molecular basis for several of these major maturity genes and QTLs. Moreover, the molecular characterization of orthologs of Arabidopsis thaliana flowering genes has enriched our understanding of the photoperiodic flowering pathway in soybean. Building on early insights into the importance of the photoreceptor phytochrome A, several circadian clock components have been integrated into the genetic network controlling flowering in soybean: E1, a repressor of FLOWERING LOCUS T orthologs, plays a central role in this network. Here, we provide an overview of recent progress in elucidating photoperiodic flowering in soybean, how it contributes to our fundamental understanding of flowering time control, and how this information could be used for molecular design and breeding of high-yielding soybean cultivars.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Understanding the genetic basis underlying domestication-related traits (DRTs) is important in order to use wild germplasm efficiently for improving yield, stress tolerance and quality of crops. This study was conducted to characterize the genetic basis of DRTs in soybean (Glycine max) using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Methods A population of 96 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cultivated (ssp. max) x wild (ssp. soja) cross was used for mapping and QTL analysis. Nine DRTs were examined in 2004 and 2005. A linkage map was constructed with 282 markers by the Kosambi function, and the QTL was detected by composite interval mapping. Key Results The early flowering and determinate habit derived from the max parent were each controlled by one major QTL, corresponding to the major genes for maturity (e1) and determinate habit (dt1), respectively. There were only one or two significant QTLs for twinning habit, pod dehiscence, seed weight and hard seededness, which each accounted for approx. 20-50\% of the total variance. A comparison with the QTLs detected previously indicated that in pod dehiscence and hard seededness, at least one major QTL was common across different crosses, whereas no such consistent QTL existed for seed weight. Conclusions Most of the DRTs in soybeans were conditioned by one or two major QTLs and a number of genotype-dependent minor QTLs. The common major QTLs identified in pod dehiscence and hard seededness may have been key loci in the domestication of soybean. The evolutionary changes toward larger seed may have occurred through the accumulation of minor changes at many QTLs. Since the major QTLs for DRTs were scattered across only six of the 20 linkage groups, and since the QTLs were not clustered, introgression of useful genes from wild to cultivated soybeans can be carried out without large obstacles.},

  abstract = {Targeted and untargeted selections including domestication and breeding efforts can reduce genetic diversity in breeding germplasm and create selective sweeps in crop genomes. The genomic regions at which selective sweeps are detected can reveal important information about signatures of selection. We have analyzed the genetic diversity within a soybean germplasm collection relevant for breeding in Europe (the EUCLEG collection), and have identified selective sweeps through a genome-wide scan comparing that collection to Chinese soybean collections. This work involved genotyping of 480 EUCLEG soybean accessions, including 210 improved varieties, 216 breeding lines and 54 landraces using the 355K SoySNP microarray. SNP calling of 477 EUCLEG accessions together with 328 Chinese soybean accessions identified 224,993 high-quality SNP markers. Population structure analysis revealed a clear differentiation between the EUCLEG collection and the Chinese materials. Further, the EUCLEG collection was sub-structured into five subgroups that were differentiated by geographical origin. No clear association between subgroups and maturity group was detected. The genetic diversity was lower in the EUCLEG collection compared to the Chinese collections. Selective sweep analysis revealed 23 selective sweep regions distributed over 12 chromosomes. Co-localization of these selective sweep regions with previously reported QTLs and genes revealed that various signatures of selection in the EUCLEG collection may be related to domestication and improvement traits including seed protein and oil content, phenology, nitrogen fixation, yield components, diseases resistance and quality. No signatures of selection related to stem determinacy were detected. In addition, absence of signatures of selection for a substantial number of QTLs related to yield, protein content, oil content and phenological traits suggests the presence of substantial genetic diversity in the EUCLEG collection. Taken together, the results obtained demonstrate that the available genetic diversity in the EUCLEG collection can be further exploited for research and breeding purposes. However, incorporation of exotic material can be considered to broaden its genetic base.},

  abstract = {Datasets of hundreds or thousands of SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) from multiple individuals per species are increasingly used to study population structure, species delimitation and shallow phylogenetics. The principal software tool to infer species or population trees from SNP data is currently the BEAST template SNAPP which uses a Bayesian coalescent analysis. However, it is computationally extremely demanding and tolerates only small amounts of missing data. We used simulated and empirical SNPs from plants (Australian Craspedia, Asteraceae, and Pelargonium, Geraniaceae) to compare species trees produced (1) by SNAPP, (2) using SVD quartets, and (3) using Bayesian and parsimony analysis with several different approaches to summarising data from multiple samples into one set of traits per species. Our aims were to explore the impact of tree topology and missing data on the results, and to test which data summarising and analyses approaches would best approximate the results obtained from SNAPP for empirical data. SVD quartets retrieved the correct topology from simulated data, as did SNAPP except in the case of a very unbalanced phylogeny. Both methods failed to retrieve the correct topology when large amounts of data were missing. Bayesian analysis of species level summary data scoring the two alleles of each SNP as independent characters and parsimony analysis of data scoring each SNP as one character produced trees with branch length distributions closest to the true trees on which SNPs were simulated. For empirical data, Bayesian inference and Dollo parsimony analysis of data scored allele-wise produced phylogenies most congruent with the results of SNAPP. In the case of study groups divergent enough for missing data to be phylogenetically informative (because of additional mutations preventing amplification of genomic fragments or bioinformatic establishment of homology), scoring of SNP data as a presence/absence matrix irrespective of allele content might be an additional option. As this depends on sampling across species being reasonably even and a random distribution of non-informative instances of missing data, however, further exploration of this approach is needed. Properly chosen data summary approaches to inferring species trees from SNP data may represent a potential alternative to currently available individual-level coalescent analyses especially for quick data exploration and when dealing with computationally demanding or patchy datasets.},

  abstract = {This study is the first assessment of the entire soybean [Glycine max (L.) Men] collection of the United State Department of Agriculture National Plant Germplasm System (USDA) reporting quantitative and population genomic parameters. It also provides a new insight into soybean germplasm structure. Germplasm studies enable plant breeders to incorporate novel genetic resources into breeding pipelines to improve valuable agronomic traits. We conducted comprehensive analyses on the 19,652 soybean accessions in the USDA-ARS germplasm collection, genotyped with the SoySNP50 K iSelect BeadChip SNP array, to elucidate the quantitative properties of existing subpopulations inferred through hierarchical clustering performed with Ward's D agglomeration method and Nei's standard genetic distance. We found the effective population size to be approximately 106 individuals based on the linkage disequilibrium of unlinked loci. The cladogram indicated the existence of eight major clusters. Each cluster displays particular properties with regard to major quantitative traits. Among those, cluster 3 represents the tropical and semi-tropical genetic material, cluster 5 displays large seeds and may represent food-grade germplasm, and cluster 7 represents the undomesticated material in the germplasm collection. The average F-ST among clusters was 0.22 and a total of 914 SNPs were exclusive to specific clusters. Our classification and characterization of the germplasm collection into major clusters provides valuable information about the genetic resources available to soybean breeders and researchers.},
