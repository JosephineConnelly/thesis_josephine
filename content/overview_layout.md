Part One "Introduction and Review" Title
======

## 1. Introduction 
Presents the topic/problem
Presents, motivates and delimits the professional topic/problem precisely and clearly using relevant professional terminology and with reference to existing literature.
Describes how the task is structured and what the purpose of the individual sub-elements is. The sub-elements are put in relation to each other and the assignment appears as a coherent text with an overall purpose.

## Main text: 
Description, explanation and discussion of results from the literature that are important in relation to the task's problem. It is typically divided into several paragraphs, where each paragraph deals with one sub-topic or one point of view, but where the connection is clear. The text must constitute an overall argument or lead to an overarching point that relates to the formulation of the problem.
#### Botanic

family, flowering, cold tolerance, biogeography, protien and fat content.
#### Agronomic

*3 pages*
#### QTL Genes pathways and physiology
*2 pages*

###  The purpose and relevance of a future with soy in the Nordics
*Half to whole page*

## Conclusion and perspective: 
The points from each sub-topic are gathered into an overarching argument, an assessment or a conclusion that answers the problem set out in the introduction. Here, the author may identify shortcomings in the literature/science or provide perspective in another way.

## Bibliography: 
Indicates the literature referred to in the text.
A prerequisite for being able to write a good literature review is a thorough orientation in the literature, so that you can define a relevant and important problem, write a good problem formulation and then select the scientific studies that are most important for the subject.
