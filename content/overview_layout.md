# introduction and literature review
 


Part One "Introduction and literature Review" (Title)
======

## 1. Introduction
*Presents, motivates and delimits the professional topic/problem precisely and clearly using relevant professional terminology and with reference to existing literature.*

*Describes how the task is structured and what the purpose of the individual sub-elements is. The sub-elements are put in relation to each other and the assignment appears as a coherent text with an overall purpose.*
topic presentation Presents glycine max
Purpose, to study the resources to see if they have potential for further research.


## Main text 
*Description, explanation and discussion of results from the literature that are important in relation to the task's problem. It is typically divided into several paragraphs, where each paragraph deals with one sub-topic or one point of view, but where the connection is clear. The text must constitute an overall argument or lead to an overarching point that relates to the formulation of the problem.*
### Soy introduction
### soy domestication
### grin 






Soybean plant growth is affected by temperature as well as photoperiod. Soybean can suffer from cold temeperatures during the flowering that effect pod size and seed formation resulting in lower yeild. (ref) 

For soybean to grow it would have to be better adapted to the growing conditions (chilling tolerence).
early ripening varaietys (maturisty scores 00-000(0?)) have to have the stable yield. 


There is a reduced level 

Swedish breeding program historical information


CCA review




## Conclusion and perspective
*The points from each sub-topic are gathered into an overarching argument, an assessment or a conclusion that answers the problem set out in the introduction. Here, the author may identify shortcomings in the literature/science or provide perspective in another way.*
what we need to know to get to the next step and answer the question of how to go forward and with what.


## Bibliography
*Indicates the literature referred to in the text. A prerequisite for being able to write a good literature review is a thorough orientation in the literature, so that you can define a relevant and important problem, write a good problem formulation and then select the scientific studies that are most important for the subject.*



# Research questions for part 1

Should we grow soy in the NE?

What are the interesting rescources?
    GRIN SNP
    CCA
    SBPA

What do we already know about these resources?
    Research done 
            CCA paper
            GRIN SNP
    Historical information about the SBPA

What more do we know about Soy?
    Domesitacation of soy
    general pogen
    The interesting traits found  
    signals of selection

What do we want to know?
    scope of my thesis
    Larger scope

Could SPBA and or CCA be interesting as a part of the future of soybean in NE?















Part Two "the scientific manuscript"

## 1. abstract

## 2. introduction
Introduction Implications and potential problems are thoroughly discussed.

## 3. results
Results/Analysis Central findings/results are clearly described and presented correctly, legibly and without defects or errors.

## 4. discussion
Discussion Conclusions are drawn, so they are logically connected to the data. Conclusions relate to the problem formulation/hypothesis and Method The procedure is carefully explained and the choice of procedure is justified.
