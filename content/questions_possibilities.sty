What is the problem/Question?
There are 136 soybeans in the NORDGEN gene bank and we want to know if they could be of use.
Why is it important?
It is important because it would be a good idea to be able to grow more protein and oil rich crops in Northern Europe.
What do we not know?
We don't know what we have.
We don't know how these NORDGEN accessions relate genetically to the rest of the soy.
We don't know whether there is genetic potential or a good starting point for future breeding programs here.

2.
bit that we do know
we know that there is the Fiskeby and a few other accessions which have shown potential
we know there was a breeding program
we know some of the founders
We know that Fiskeby has been used in breeding for canadian cultivars successfully

but... (smaller knowledge gap and transition to next paragraph)
but we want to show that the founders were indeed the founders
and that the Swedish accessions are a genetic unit.

3.
bit that we do know:
but we do know there was a breeding program with resulting cultivars.
but... (smaller knowledge gap and transition to next paragraph)
but we would like to know if the selection of founders and succeeding breeding program if they did select for traits or if it was just drift?

4.
bit that we do know:
We know there are areas of interest in the soybean genome. Flowering and cold tolerance.
but... (smaller knowledge gap and transition to next paragraph)
We would like to look for signals of selection there.

When these questions are answered we can better know how to proceed for optimal breeding for soybean in NWE.
