Part One "Introduction and Review"
======

## 1. Introduction (1)
Presents the topic/problem
Presents, motivates and delimits the professional topic/problem precisely and clearly using relevant professional terminology and with reference to existing literature.
Describes how the task is structured and what the purpose of the individual sub-elements is. The sub-elements are put in relation to each other and the assignment appears as a coherent text with an overall purpose. [@holmberg:1973aa]

Soy is a very successful crop grown all over the world. so much is produced. The demand only increses. 
It originated in china at this and that latatude and is a short day plant. 
It is successfully grown in north and south america for feed and is imported to europe in great amounts (ref) for feeding cattle and pigs. 
Soy is the perfect feed crop because of its protien and oil content. More than three quarters of that produced is fed to animals. It is also gaining populatrty as a means to enough protien in a vegetarien diet (20% of produced ampunt). But there are some negative tendencies when it come to importing so much. 
its not sustainable to move that much goods across the world. 
Alot of the soy that is bought and imported from southamerica is cultivated with the reputation of being linked to deforistation (1/5th of deforistation is due to cropland expansion by crops like soy and oil palm (ref)), unsustainable in all kinds of other ways? 
Thirdly there is a more recent interest in sourcing societys fundamentals closer to home. 
So there is great interest in the breeding of higher protien rich crops here in europe, as can be seen with the reemergent interest in other nitrogen fixing crops such as Faba Bean (Vicia faba) or other legumes. 

## Main text: 
Description, explanation and discussion of results from the literature that are important in relation to the task's problem. It is typically divided into several paragraphs, where each paragraph deals with one sub-topic or one point of view, but where the connection is clear. The text must constitute an overall argument or lead to an overarching point that relates to the formulation of the problem.
Glycine max could be a future crop i europe. 
Itroduce Glycine max from the several perspectives, the botanic, agronomic and domistancation hitory and recent history in the north. 
The idea is that it could be a good idea to research the possibility of developing elite cultivars that would grow well in Northern Europe. The idea would be to look more at accessions that we already know. 
Population genetics can show relations and genetic distances.
The traits we know that have an importance in northern europe.
detection of selection signatures

There is the idea that it could be cleaver for socioeconomic and environmental purposes to be more self sufficient when it comes to plant protiens and fats in europe. We import soy and other crops mainly as feed to our animals that then go on to be a source of meat protien for human consumption. 
Our meat consumption is not sustainable. we should be able to source (grow) our protien for meat more locally. We import fo much soy into europe. 
Also Soy can be a great source of vegetarian soybean for direct or processed human consumption. 
Soy is also a vital ingredient (sot lycitine) in many processed foods. (numbers, ref)
The unstability of our energy resources since war in europe also has rekindled this idea of being self sustainable in europe as an important

## Conclusion and perspective:  (10)
The points from each sub-topic are gathered into an overarching argument, an assessment or a conclusion that answers the problem set out in the introduction. Here, the author may identify shortcomings in the literature/science or provide perspective in another way.

## Bibliography: 
Indicates the literature referred to in the text.
A prerequisite for being able to write a good literature review is a thorough orientation in the literature, so that you can define a relevant and important problem, write a good problem formulation and then select the scientific studies that are most important for the subject.































PART 2
======

introduction part 2

Id like to start by introducing the data
and the historical metadata that we uncovered.
The preparation of the data done by Torben.
The filtering of the data for analysis done by me.

Analysis:

**part 1 (hypothesis 1.)**

Show the data visually in terms of relation.
A pca showing
- Wild soy.
- founders
- subset of land cultivars asia
- subset of elite culitivars South America
- SA (swedish accessions)

A PCA with
CCA and SA showing maturity score

Clustering groups and statistical analysis to show the founders and SA are or same origin.

phylogeny to see phylogenetic placement in relation to general soy population.

**Part 2 (hypothesis 2)**

Detect a decrease in genetic diversity as measure of sequence variation (Θ theta, Number of polymorphic sites in genotypic sample corrected for sample size).
Nucleotide diversity as (π pi, the expected heterozygosity per nucleotide site).  
LD increase.
Change in allele frequency FST. (Selection/Drift/geneflow)

 look at Fst for subset accessions representing:
 - Wild
 - CCA
 - To landrace/ Founders
 - to SA

 **Part 3 (hypothesis 3)**

 looking for signals of Selection
- Scan for selective signals over the genome  
- choose and introduce chosen parts of the genome.
- Allele frequence differentation (like Fst) at genes
- Haplotype analysis of genes




I guess this purpose of the research is two main things things.
1. the swedish accessions. what are they, where did they come from and what can i find out about them.

2. Then there is the genetic relevance of the swedish accessions in relation to the germpasm as a whole, and in relation to the core collection. 

To later be able to answer the question. Are these swedish accessions a starting point for breeding programs for northern european soybean breeding programs. 

The purpose of this investigation is to start the investigation of the swedish soybean accessions. Id like to answer some initial questions to have an overview of the genetic data before us. what are these swedish accessions



Part Two "the scientific manuscript"
======

## 1. abstract

## 2. introduction
### Introduction Implications and potential problems are thoroughly discussed.

## 3. results
### Results/Analysis Central findings/results are clearly described and presented correctly, legibly and without defects or errors.

## 4. discussion
### Discussion Conclusions are drawn, so they are logically connected to the data. Conclusions relate to the problem formulation/hypothesis and Method The procedure is carefully explained and the choice of procedure is justified.
