Part One "Introduction and Review"
======

## 1. Introduction
### Glycine max set the scene. a very short intro to topic

##  2. Purpose and relevance
###  The purpose and relevance of a future with soy in the Nordics
I guess this research is two main things things.
1. the swedish accessions. what are they, where did they come from and what can i find out about them.

2. Then there is the relevance of the swedish accessions in relation to the germpasm as a whole, and in relation to the core collection.

The purpose of this investigation is to start the investigation of the swedish soybean accessions. Id like to answer some initial questions to have an overview of the genetic data before us. what are these swedish accessions

#### Purpose: the idea of breeding and then growing soy in the Nordics
#### Relevance: why its a good idea  	
#### Overview: the framework of the project. what I’m going to research.
Id like to start by introducing the data
and the historical metadata that we uncovered.
The preparation of the data done by Torben.
The filtering of the data for analysis done by me.

Analysis:

**part 1 (hypothesis 1.)**

Show the data visually in terms of relation.
A pca showing
- Wild soy.
- founders
- subset of land cultivars asia
- subset of elite culitivars South America
- SA (swedish accessions)

A PCA with
CCA and SA showing maturity score

Clustering groups and statistical analysis to show the founders and SA are or same origin.

phylogeny to see phylogenetic placement in relation to general soy population.

**Part 2 (hypothesis 2)**

Detect a decrease in genetic diversity as measure of sequence variation (Θ theta, Number of polymorphic sites in genotypic sample corrected for sample size).
Nucleotide diversity as (π pi, the expected heterozygosity per nucleotide site).  
LD increase.
Change in allele frequency FST. (Selection/Drift/geneflow)

 look at Fst for subset accessions representing:
 - Wild
 - CCA
 - To landrace/ Founders
 - to SA

 **Part 3 (hypothesis 3)**

 looking for signals of Selection
- Scan for selective signals over the genome  
- choose and introduce chosen parts of the genome.
- Allele frequence differentation (like Fst) at genes
- Haplotype analysis of genes


## 3. Structure / reading guide
### Structure of the paper explained or laid out for the reader

## 4. Topic and Problem
### Glycine max an introduction
#### Botanic		
family, flowering, cold tolerance, biogeography, protien and fat content.
#### Agronomic
protein and fat content. The amounts imported to europe / northern europe. 	
#### Domestication history
#### Population genetics
#### what’s known of soy traits,
#### QTL Genes pathways and physiology
Add molecular genetics studies on flowering, cold tolerance, seed coat, etc.

### Problem formulation and hypotheses
#### Overall purpose of the research - explorative -for further use
#### Hypotheses

**Hypothesis 1. Swedish accession genetic origin**
The 157 accessions from the NordGen gene bank (Swedish breeding program accessions, SBPA) were part of the Swedish breeding program (SBP) of the 1940s-1980s and the 12 accessions found are founders of this breeding program.

**Hypothesis 2. The bottleneck will be evaluated.**
The founder population to the breeding population & the breeding program created a bottleneck, the effects of this is drift and will be detected as a reduction of Ne.

**Hypothesis 3. Selection signatures**
Selection occurred during the Swedish breeding program.

#### Postulates				

## 5. Theory and Method review
### use of theory(s), empiricism and method
#### what I think happened (using Toulmin’s model of argument?) using:
####Theory behind my postulates using empirical research
####the methods I will use to analyse the data		

## 6. Discussion
###  a discussion of the methods and tools (implications and problems)

make a reference: [@saleem:2021aa] Figure out how to do this later. 



















Part Two "the scientific manuscript"
======

## 1. abstract

## 2. introduction
### Introduction Implications and potential problems are thoroughly discussed.

## 3. results
### Results/Analysis Central findings/results are clearly described and presented correctly, legibly and without defects or errors.

## 4. discussion
### Discussion Conclusions are drawn, so they are logically connected to the data. Conclusions relate to the problem formulation/hypothesis and Method The procedure is carefully explained and the choice of procedure is justified.

## 5. methods

## 6. references
