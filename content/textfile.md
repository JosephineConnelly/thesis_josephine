## 1. Introduction
Presents the topic/problem
Presents, motivates and delimits the professional topic/problem precisely and clearly using relevant professional terminology and with reference to existing literature.
Describes how the task is structured and what the purpose of the individual sub-elements is. The sub-elements are put in relation to each other and the assignment appears as a coherent text with an overall purpose. [@holmberg:1973]

*half page*
It is the pourpose of this paper to review what 

Soy is a very successful crop grown all over the world. * so much is produced each year. The demand only increses. To reach the GWDs they say we need to grow more soy for human protien consumption to reach the goal #2 of no hunger. 
*Glycine max* is the domesticated species of *Glycine soya* that originated in china and was domesticated to *Glycine max* around 5-6thousand yeasr ago (ref). at this and that latatude and is a short day plant with seeds high in protien and oil (ref). 
It is successfully grown in north and south america for feed and is imported to europe in great amounts (4/5ths?)(ref) for feeding cattle and pigs. 
Soy is the perfect feed crop because of its protien and oil content. More than three quarters of that produced is fed to animals. It is also gaining populatrty as a means to enough protien in a vegetarien diet (20% of produced ampunt). 
There are things to considerate when it comes to growing europes animal feed on the other side of the earth. Transport. Deforistation (1/5th of deforistation is due to cropland expansion by crops like soy and oil palm (ref)). Food security  (there is a more recent interest in sourcing societys fundamentals closer to home.) and autonomy, both in europe and where the soy is grown. The animal waste that dosent connect to the landuse in the area. too much animal waste and not enough land to put it on. that would be different if there was less import.? 
So there is great interest in the breeding of higher protien rich crops here in europe, as can be seen with the reemergent interest in other nitrogen fixing crops such as Faba Bean (Vicia faba) or other legumes. Growing soybean in NWE North Western Europe could be another solution.

## Main text: 
*Description, explanation and discussion of results from the literature that are important in relation to the task's problem. It is typically divided into several paragraphs, where each paragraph deals with one sub-topic or one point of view, but where the connection is clear. The text must constitute an overall argument or lead to an overarching point that relates to the formulation of the problem.*

Glycine max could be a future crop i europe. 
Itroduce Glycine max from the several perspectives, the botanic, agronomic and domistancation hitory and recent history in the north. 
The idea is that it could be a good idea to research the possibility of developing elite cultivars that would grow well in Northern Europe. The idea would be to look more at accessions that we already know of and compare. 
Population genetics can show relations and genetic distances.
The traits we know that have an importance in northern europe.
Detection of selection signatures in genes of interest

paragraphs wide explenantion:

## Soy botany & Soy biotic and a biotic adaptions or difficutlys in relation to growing in higher latatudes. 
Add molecular genetics studies on flowering, cold tolerance, seed coat, etc.

## Soy agronomy & Climate change and soy

## Soy domestication
[@]
Traces of soybean in the literature have been found in The Chou Dynasty (1122–221 BC) of China. And as the Dynasty expanded with trade soybean migrated with people to South China, Korea, Japan and South East Asia [@hymowitz1970]. However, for soybean to already be a trade commodaty at that point the domestication process must have tooken place well before. Modern cultivated soybean (*Glycine max* (L.) Merr.) is estimated to have been domesticated from wild soybean (*Glycine soja* Sieb. & Zucc.) in East Asia 6000–9000 yr ago [@carter04],[@kim2012b]. There are several hypotheses as to the origin location,

wild soybean grows commonly in eastern China (from 24--53°N lat.), Japan, Korea, and the eastern extremes of Russia [@carter04]

*paragraph*

There is the idea that it could be cleaver for socioeconomic and environmental purposes to be more self sufficient when it comes to plant protiens and fats in europe. We import soy and other crops mainly as feed to our animals that then go on to be a source of meat protien for human consumption. 
Our meat consumption is not sustainable. we should be able to source (grow) our protien for meat more locally. We import fo much soy into europe. 
Also Soy can be a great source of vegetarian soybean for direct or processed human consumption. 
Soy is also a vital ingredient (sot lycitine) in many processed foods. (numbers, ref)
The unstability of our energy resources since war in europe also has rekindled this idea of being self sustainable in europe as an important

## What we know and dont know

1. What is the problem/Question?
There is 136 soybeans in the NORDGEN gene bank and we want to know if they could be of use. 
Why is it important?
It is important because it would be a good idea to be able to grow more protien and oil rich crops in Northern Europe.
What do we not know?
We dont know what we have. 
We dont know how these NORDGEN accessions relate genetically to the rest of the soy.
We dont know whether there is genetic potential or a good starting point for future breeding programs here. 

2. 
bit that we do know
we know that there is the Fiskeby and a few other accessions which have shown potential
we know there was a breeding program
we susspect who the founders are
We know that Fiskeby has been used in breeding for canadian cultivars successfully

but... (smaller knowledge gap and transition to next paragraph)
but we want to show that the founders were indeed the founders
and that the swedish accessions are a genetic unit. 

3. 
bit that we do know:
but we do know there was a breeding program with resulting cultivars.
but... (smaller knowledge gap and transition to next paragraph)
but we would like to know if the selection of founders and succeeding breeding program if they did select for traits or of it was just drift?

4. 
bit that we do know:
we know there are aresas of interest in the soybean genome. Flowering and cold tolerence. 
but... (smaller knowledge gap and transition to next paragraph)
We would like to look for signals of selection there. 

When these questions are answered we can better know how to proceed for optimal breeding for soybean in NWE. 





## Conclusion and perspective
*The points from each sub-topic are gathered into an overarching argument, an assessment or a conclusion that answers the problem set out in the introduction. Here, the author may identify shortcomings in the literature/science or provide perspective in another way.*
*2 pages*

## Bibliography: 
*Indicates the literature referred to in the text. A prerequisite for being able to write a good literature review is a thorough orientation in the literature, so that you can define a relevant and important problem, write a good problem formulation and then select the scientific studies that are most important for the subject.*

PART 2
======

introduction part 2

Id like to start by introducing the data
and the historical metadata that we uncovered.
The preparation of the data done by Torben.
The filtering of the data for analysis done by me.

Analysis:

**part 1 (hypothesis 1.)**

Show the data visually in terms of relation.
A pca showing
- Wild soy.
- founders
- subset of land cultivars asia
- subset of elite culitivars South America
- SA (swedish accessions)

A PCA with
CCA and SA showing maturity score

Clustering groups and statistical analysis to show the founders and SA are or same origin.

phylogeny to see phylogenetic placement in relation to general soy population.

**Part 2 (hypothesis 2)**

Detect a decrease in genetic diversity as measure of sequence variation (Θ theta, Number of polymorphic sites in genotypic sample corrected for sample size).
Nucleotide diversity as (π pi, the expected heterozygosity per nucleotide site).  
LD increase.
Change in allele frequency FST. (Selection/Drift/geneflow)

 look at Fst for subset accessions representing:
 - Wild
 - CCA
 - To landrace/ Founders
 - to SA

 **Part 3 (hypothesis 3)**

 looking for signals of Selection
- Scan for selective signals over the genome  
- choose and introduce chosen parts of the genome.
- Allele frequence differentation (like Fst) at genes
- Haplotype analysis of genes




I guess this purpose of the research is two main things things.
1. the swedish accessions. what are they, where did they come from and what can i find out about them.

2. Then there is the genetic relevance of the swedish accessions in relation to the germpasm as a whole, and in relation to the core collection. 

To later be able to answer the question. Are these swedish accessions a starting point for breeding programs for northern european soybean breeding programs. 

The purpose of this investigation is to start the investigation of the swedish soybean accessions. Id like to answer some initial questions to have an overview of the genetic data before us. what are these swedish accessions
