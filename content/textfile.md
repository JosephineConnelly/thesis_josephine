*purpose*
It is the purpose of this review to present and motivate an expansion of cultivation range of soybean in noth-western Europe in the future and to review that which is relevant to the expansion of the cultivation range. There is a reduced level of genetic variation in elite breeding populations (ref) which means that for the case of soybean, there is a need to look elsewhere for selection of suitable germplasm. Research into relevant accessions have been identified to have potential for abiotic adaptation to cold tolerance for a rapidly changing climate [@haupt20].
Recently awareness has grown around accessions in the Nordgen genebank that are the intermediary and results from a Swedish breeding program in the 40-70s using a mixture of elite cultivars and Japanese landraces. It could be very interesting to know more about these accessions.


for a rapidly changing climate, or de novo adaptation of crops to expand cultivation ranges.


Soy is a very successful crop grown all over the world (mention shortly the range). So and so much is produced each year and the demand only increases. An example of this is the report from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) goals where it is stated that x much more soy for human protein consumption will be needed to reach the SDG goal number 2 of Zero Hunger.
*Glycine max* is the domesticated species of *Glycine soya* that originated in China and was domesticated to *Glycine max* around 6000–9000 years ago [@carter04],[@kim2012b]. at this and that latitude.
*why soybean is relevant: because it's an important crop*
It is successfully grown (where) latitudes. in north and south america for feed and is imported to europe in great amounts (4/5ths?)(ref) for animal feed. Soy is the perfect feed crop because of its protein and oil content. More than three quarters of that produced is fed to animals. It is also gaining popularity as a means to enough protein in a vegetarian diet (20% of produced amount).
There are things to consider when it comes to growing Europe's animal feed on the other side of the earth. Transport. Deforestation. (1/5th of deforestation is due to cropland expansion by crops like soy and oil palm (ref)). Food security  (there is a more recent interest in sourcing (society's fundamentals *other words* closer to home.) autonomy, both in europe and where the soy is grown. The animal waste that doesn't connect to the land use in the area. too much animal waste and not enough land to put it on. that would be different if there was less import.?
On top of the interest in the breeding of higher protein rich crops here in europe, as can be seen with the re-emergent interest in other nitrogen fixing crops such as Faba Bean (Vicia faba) or other legumes, growing soybean in NWE North Western Europe could be a logical addition to the crop rotation.


*The idea to develop soybean as a crop in northwest europe*
The idea is that it could be a good idea to research the possibility of developing elite cultivars that would grow well in Northwestern Europe.
Review what we know and to investigate and research accessions that we already know of (Swedish) and compare (CCA+GRIN).
*what to review:*
Soy domestication and the Detection of selection signatures in genes of interest relevant to the crop in general and abiotic adaptation.
The state of soybean agronomy and what are the climate change considerations for the future.
Population genetics can show relations and genetic diversity underlining the need for new genetic resources in the breeding pool.
abiotic adaptations needed and climate change considerations. The traits we know have an importance in northern europe.




we should grow soybean in NWE
Because
1. Soybean would be good in crop rotation as a legume
2. The composition of high protein and high oil is advantageous and is also the reason why so and so much is imported to the Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway) each year.
3. Climate change
4. food security


*why good idea #4*
less international dependency: It seems that the future europe, for socioeconomic and environmental purposes will be more self sufficient when it comes to resources including plant proteins and fats sourcing. We import soy and other crops mainly as feed to our animals that then go on to be a source of meat protein for human consumption.
*why good idea #4*
Our meat consumption is not sustainable. we should be able to source (grow) our protein for meat more locally. We import so much soy into europe.
Also Soy can be a great source of vegetarian soybean for direct or processed human consumption.
Soy is also a vital ingredient (soy lecithin) in many processed foods. (numbers, ref)
The instability of our energy resources since war in Europe also has rekindled this idea of being self sustainable in Europe as an important political agenda.


## Main text:
*Description, explanation and discussion of results from the literature that are important in relation to the task's problem. It is typically divided into several paragraphs, where each paragraph deals with one sub-topic or one point of view, but where the connection is clear. The text must constitute an overall argument or lead to an overarching point that relates to the formulation of the problem.*


Introduce Glycine max from the several perspectives, the botanic, agronomic and domestication history and recent history in the north.




## Soy botany & Soy biotic and abiotic adaptations or difficulties in relation to growing in higher latitudes.   


Soybean
(*Glycine max* (L.) Merr.)
Kingdom: Plantae
Phylum: Magnoliophyta


   Class: Magnoliopsida
   Order: Fabales
   Family: Fabaceae
   Subfamily: Faboideae
   Genus: Glycine
   Species: G. max
   Botanical name: Glycine max (L.) Merr.
   Common name: Soybean, Soya bean


*Glycine max* is a short day plant of the family *Fabaceae* also known as a Legume, it is one of the plant families that has a symbiosis with bacteria in nodes in the roots which fixate Nitrogen.




## Soy agronomy & Climate change and soy

selection of suitable germplasm with phenotypic data
to increase germplasm utilization [@haupt20]


## Soy domestication
[@]


wild soybean grows commonly in eastern China (from 24--53°N lat.), Japan, Korea, and the eastern extremes of Russia [@carter04]


Traces of soybean in the literature have been found in The Chou Dynasty (1122–221 BC) of China. And as the Dynasty expanded with trade, soybeans migrated with people to South China, Korea, Japan and SouthEast Asia [@hymowitz1970]. However, for soybean to already be a trade commodity at that point the domestication process must have taken place well before. Modern cultivated soybean *Glycine max* is estimated to have been domesticated from wild soybean (*Glycine soja* Sieb. & Zucc.) in East Asia 6000–9000 yr ago [@carter04],[@kim2012b].


There are three main hypotheses as to the origin of soybean as it is known today.




origin hypothesis ![Description \label{fig:1}](images/origin_hypothesis.jpg) fig ref [@sedivy17]


- Single origin (ref)
- multiple origin
- Complex origin [@lee11], [@kim2012b]






## Soybean popgen


genetic architecture of soybeans
genetic bottlenecks
Several severe genetic bottlenecks occurred during soybean domestication. During domestication to the landraces the sequence diversity in comparison to the wild species was halved, with 81% of rare alleles lost [@hyten06]
and two major bottlenecks when very few landraces were used in the development of the north american modern cultivars and then on to the breeding of the past 75 years in america to the elite cultivars there is now.

## Soy genebanks


"The largest collection for G. max is maintained at the Institute of Crop Germplasm Resources in China which has over 23,000 accessions while the second largest collection is maintained at the USDA Soybean Germplasm collection in Urbana, IL, USA which contains over 18,000 accessions (Carter et al., 2004)." from book : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780983079101500078

## New questions and possibilities
## What we know and don't know


1.
What is the problem/Question?
There are 136 soybeans in the NORDGEN gene bank and we want to know if they could be of use.
Why is it important?
It is important because it would be a good idea to be able to grow more protein and oil rich crops in Northern Europe.
What do we not know?
We don't know what we have.
We don't know how these NORDGEN accessions relate genetically to the rest of the soy.
We don't know whether there is genetic potential or a good starting point for future breeding programs here.


2.
bit that we do know
we know that there is the Fiskeby and a few other accessions which have shown potential
we know there was a breeding program
we know some of the founders
We know that Fiskeby has been used in breeding for canadian cultivars successfully


but... (smaller knowledge gap and transition to next paragraph)
but we want to show that the founders were indeed the founders
and that the Swedish accessions are a genetic unit.


3.
bit that we do know:
but we do know there was a breeding program with resulting cultivars.
but... (smaller knowledge gap and transition to next paragraph)
but we would like to know if the selection of founders and succeeding breeding program if they did select for traits or if it was just drift?


4.
bit that we do know:
We know there are areas of interest in the soybean genome. Flowering and cold tolerance.
but... (smaller knowledge gap and transition to next paragraph)
We would like to look for signals of selection there.


When these questions are answered we can better know how to proceed for optimal breeding for soybean in NWE.


## Conclusion and perspective
*The points from each subtopic are gathered into an overarching argument, an assessment or a conclusion that answers the problem set out in the introduction. Here, the author may identify shortcomings in the literature/science or provide perspective in another way.*

## Bibliography:
*Indicates the literature referred to in the text. A prerequisite for being able to write a good literature review is a thorough orientation in the literature, so that you can define a relevant and important problem, write a good problem formulation and then select the scientific studies that are most important for the subject.*


PART 2
======

introduction part 2

Id like to start by introducing the data
and the historical metadata that we uncovered.
The preparation of the data done by Torben.
The filtering of the data for analysis done by me.

Analysis:

**part 1 (hypothesis 1.)**

Show the data visually in terms of relation.
A pca showing
- Wild soy.
- founders
- subset of land cultivars asia
- subset of elite culitivars South America
- SA (swedish accessions)

A PCA with
CCA and SA showing maturity score

Clustering groups and statistical analysis to show the founders and SA are or same origin.

phylogeny to see phylogenetic placement in relation to general soy population.

**Part 2 (hypothesis 2)**

Detect a decrease in genetic diversity as measure of sequence variation (Θ theta, Number of polymorphic sites in genotypic sample corrected for sample size).
Nucleotide diversity as (π pi, the expected heterozygosity per nucleotide site).  
LD increase.
Change in allele frequency FST. (Selection/Drift/geneflow)

 look at Fst for subset accessions representing:
 - Wild
 - CCA
 - To landrace/ Founders
 - to SA

 **Part 3 (hypothesis 3)**

 looking for signals of Selection
- Scan for selective signals over the genome  
- choose and introduce chosen parts of the genome.
- Allele frequence differentation (like Fst) at genes
- Haplotype analysis of genes




I guess this purpose of the research is two main things things.
1. the swedish accessions. what are they, where did they come from and what can i find out about them.

2. Then there is the genetic relevance of the swedish accessions in relation to the germpasm as a whole, and in relation to the core collection. 

To later be able to answer the question. Are these swedish accessions a starting point for breeding programs for northern european soybean breeding programs. 

The purpose of this investigation is to start the investigation of the swedish soybean accessions. Id like to answer some initial questions to have an overview of the genetic data before us. what are these swedish accessions
