**purpose** draft 2

It is the purpose of this review to present the relevant knowledge and research about Soybean in northwest Europe as well as to motivate de novo expansion of the cultivation range of Soybean to north-western Europe. And to review that which is relevant to the expansion of the cultivation range and to collect the historical and now relevant soybean endeavours that have hitherto been stored in the historical literature and the NordGen seedbanks. 

**Why it is Important: low diversity** draft 2

also see [@dottinger23] for great reasons for why we need to breed for regional adaption in soybean.  

According to [@gizlice96] (and pedigree records? (ref)) only 19 landraces are thought to have contributed as much as 85% of the genes to the North American breeding pools retaining 72% of genome diversity and being furthermore imposed by selective breeding, 79% of rare alleles were lost [@hyten06].  
Adaptation of crops to expand cultivation ranges.
This reduced level of genetic variation in elite breeding populations means that in the case of soybean, there is a need to look elsewhere to increase germplasm utilization for abiotic adaptation. Relevant accessions to have the potential for abiotic adaptation to cold tolerance for a rapidly changing climate have identified [@haupt20].

**the answer?** draft 2

But also, recently, awareness has grown around accessions in the NordGen gene bank that are the intermediary and results from a Swedish breeding program in the 40-the 70s using a mixture of elite cultivars and Japanese landraces. It could be very interesting to know more about these accessions, their diversity and what more? their relation to the rest of the germplasm. if there is a bottleneck already? rare alleles in comparison to american lost rare alleles? rather than looking at specific signatures of selection. hmm or is this the next things i would look at given the time. 

**timely** draft 2

The demand of soybean production only increases and has even more than doubled since the year 2000 to 2020 [@fao23]. An example of this is the report from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) goals where it is stated that x much more soy for human protein consumption will be needed to reach the SDG goal number 2 of Zero Hunger.
*Glycine max* is the domesticated species of *Glycine soya* that originated in China and was domesticated to *Glycine max* around 6000–9000 years ago [@carter04],[@kim2012b]. at this and that latitude.

**why soybean is relevant: because it's an important crop** draft 2

Soybean is a crop of global economic importance. It is successfully grown (where) latitudes. in north and south america for feed and is imported to europe in great amounts (4/5ths?)(ref) for animal feed. Soy is the perfect feed crop because of its protein and oil content. More than three quarters of that produced is fed to animals. It is also gaining popularity as a means to enough protein in a vegetarian diet (20% of produced amount).

**there are downsides of the status quo**

There are things to consider when it comes to growing Europe's animal feed on the other side of the earth. Transport. Deforestation. (1/5th of deforestation is due to cropland expansion by crops like soy and oil palm (ref)). Food security  (there is a more recent interest in sourcing (society's fundamentals **other words** closer to home.) autonomy, both in europe and where the soy is grown. The animal waste that doesn't connect to the land use in the area. too much animal waste and not enough land to put it on. that would be different if there was less import.?
On top of the interest in the breeding of higher protein rich crops here in europe, as can be seen with the re-emergent interest in other nitrogen fixing crops such as Faba Bean (Vicia faba) or other legumes, growing soybean in NWE North Western Europe could be a logical addition to the crop rotation.


**The idea to develop soybean as a crop in northwest europe** draft 1

The idea is that it could be a good idea to research the possibility of developing elite cultivars that would grow well in Northwestern Europe.
Review what we know and to investigate and research accessions that we already know of (Swedish) and compare (CCA+GRIN).

**what to review:** draft 1

Soy domestication and the Detection of selection signatures in genes of interest relevant to the crop in general and abiotic adaptation.
The state of soybean agronomy and what are the climate change considerations for the future.
Population genetics can show relations and genetic diversity underlining the need for new genetic resources in the breeding pool.
abiotic adaptations needed and climate change considerations. The traits we know have an importance in northern europe.

we should grow soybean in NWE Because:

- The composition of high protein and high oil is advantageous and is also the reason why so and so much is imported to the Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway) each year.

- Climate change

- Soybean would be good in crop rotation as a legume

- food security

**composition**

**climate change**

Soybean is a unique crop because, as other legumes it has high protein content, but uniquely from other domesticated protein rich crops, there doesn't follow along a lot of carbohydrates in the seed. This makes soybean a fitting protein source. Furthermore, the protein content (aprrox. X%) and quality @messina22 make it the most prevalent and cheap source of protein [@messina22],[@fang22]. 

**why good idea food security**

less international dependency: It seems that the future europe, for socioeconomic and environmental purposes will be more self sufficient when it comes to resources including plant proteins and fats sourcing. We import soy and other crops mainly as feed to our animals that then go on to be a source of meat protein for human consumption.

**why good idea food security**

"The production of meat has significantly larger environmental and climate footprints than the production of plant-based foods""Meat produces more emissions per unit of energy compared with that of plant-based foods because energy is lost at each trophic level." 
we should be able to source (grow) our plant based protein more locally. We import so much soy into europe  x ref.
Soybean is a great source of vegetarian soybean for direct or processed human consumption. According to [@messina22], soy-based meat substitutes compare well with their animal-based counterparts "because of the large acreage devoted to growing soybeans, this legume has the greatest potential for meeting the caloric and protein needs of a growing global population." Additionally, soybean is already a reference for 
Soy is also a vital ingredient (soy lecithin) in many processed foods. (numbers, ref)
The instability of our energy resources since war in Europe also has rekindled this idea of being self sustainable in Europe as an important political agenda.

## Main text body:

**Description, explanation and discussion of results from the literature that are important in relation to the task's problem. It is typically divided into several paragraphs, where each paragraph deals with one sub-topic or one point of view, but where the connection is clear. The text must constitute an overall argument or lead to an overarching point that relates to the formulation of the problem.**

Introduce Glycine max from the several perspectives, the botanic, agronomic and domestication history and recent history in the north.

## Soy domestication and botany 500 [ ] draft1

### **general introduction to soybean in a botanic sense** draft1

Soybean is an annual short day plant, meaning it will start to flower when the day length gets shorter and reaches a critical point. This Photoperiod sensitivity gives soybean a natural distribution range to the high latatudes. *Glycine max*   

   Kingdom: Plantae
   Phylum: Magnoliophyta
   Class: Magnoliopsida
   Order: Fabales
   Family: Fabaceae
   Subfamily: Faboideae
   Genus: Glycine
   Species: G. max
   Botanical name: Glycine max (L. Merr.)
   Common name: Soybean, Soya bean

*Glycine max* is a short day plant of the family *Fabaceae* also known as a Legume, it is one of the plant families that has a symbiosis with bacteria in nodes in the roots which fixate Nitrogen. Autogamous. 
*Glycine max* 2n=40 chromosome the genus and polyploidy interesting in speciation or becoming the genus glycine. 


### **domestication time and place** draft1

wild soybean grows commonly in eastern China (from 24--53°N lat.), Japan, Korea, and the eastern extremes of Russia [@carter04].

Traces of the cultivated soybean *Glycine max* in the literature have been found in The Chou Dynasty (1122–221 BC) of China. And as the Dynasty expanded with trade, soybeans migrated with people to South China, Korea, Japan and SouthEast Asia [@hymowitz1970]. However, for soybean to already be a trade commodity at that point the domestication process must have taken place well before. Modern cultivated soybean *Glycine max* is estimated to have been domesticated from wild soybean (*Glycine soja* Sieb. & Zucc.) in East Asia 6000–9000 yr ago [@carter04],[@kim2012b].

### **Origin hypotheses** (draft 1)

It is still a debated as to whether *Glycine max* or originates solely from *Glycine soy* as the single origin hypothesis [@sedivy17]. The other tow debated hypotheses are the multiple origin (this is this and that) and the Complex origin of soybean considers that *Glycine max* and an intermediate *Glycine gracialis* formed a complex eventually to become domesticised to *Glycine max* [@lee11], [@kim2012b].

## Soy agronomy/economy  300 [ ] draft1

### **Is there a need for more detail on how big soy is in the world?** Alot of the introduction psrt should actually be moved here. 

Soybean is the main source of plant protein and oil in the world, worldwide production in 2020 was 353.46 million tons. In The European Union in the same year 2.69 million tons were produced, and only 2560 tonnes in Northern Europe [@fao23]. One fifth 
of the soybean produced is used for human consumption. The oil is the main source for cooking oil in the world and the      [@fang22]

### **important crop due to all the uses. food feed, the production of biofuels, bioplastics, and other industrial products.**

protein quality [@gorissen18] 30-45% protein and 15-25% oil

field trial in dk
2009 "It is possible to grow soybeans in Denmark, but under conventional cultivation conditions will production could hardly compete with imports roasted soybeans. As a niche production, a yield of around 20 hkg/ha Danish-bred, organic soybeans might be profitable, especially when sold for consumption.
Important cultivation aspects arehj early establishment of varieties that flower and ripen early as well as the development of methods for harvesting, cleaning and drying off the seeds." [@petersen09] In similar field trials conducted in 2010 included several of the swedish accessions, where the yield for Fiskeby V was only 11.2hkg/ha. [@petersen10]

### **transition?**

These traits effect the distribution of soybean as a crop. 
can soybean grow in europe? [@kurasch17], [@petersen10] 

### **plant stages as defined in V1-V ?. R1-R8** 
The V stages are defined by the number of trifoliate leaves that have developed (unrolled) on the main stem, not the branches.
VE Stage: Emergence
VC Stage: Cotyledon
V1 - V3 Stages: First, Second & Third Trifoliate
V4 Stage: Fourth Trifoliolate. branching beginning
V5 Stage: Fifth Trifoliate. About a week until flowering begins

R1: Beginning bloom. At least one flower appears always on the third to sixth node on the main stem. The plant is at the V7 to V10 stage.

R2: Full Flowering
R3: Beginning Pod Development
R4: Full Pod
R5: Beginning Seed
R6: Full Seed
R7: Beginning Maturity
R8: Full Maturity




### **MG** draft2

There is a broad variation in sensitivity to photoperiod in soybean cultivars. The maturity group (MG) system is widely used to group soybean varieties based on their growth periods and photothermal responses, categorized based on their growth periods and photothermal responses. Although, there is no universal standard or quantifiable methodology for (MG) classification (also referred to as Maturity Group Reference (MGR)). There are 13 MGs ranging from MG 000 for the very early-maturing varieties to MG X for the latest-maturing varieties, with a possible extension of this range coming since MG 0000 varieties have been described and are used in more recent papers classifying maturity groups [@song19], [@jia14].


### **are there similar places (where soy is grown? canada japan.. why not just adapt their cultivars? how are they different**

see chapter from book ordered Soybean: botany, production and uses. 
 

for the north the ability to reach full maturity is the problem? what does the different papers say. 


### **crop rotation and nitrogen fixation** *mention here or somewhere*

Soybean as a legume is vital for crop rotation, not only because it is a good crop to have before a grain, but if it is also a cash crop, then even better. 


## Soybean pop gen 500 [] draft1

### **transition paragraph? whats happened after the domestication. short history in two sentences.**

Several severe genetic bottlenecks occurred during soybean domestication. During domestication to the landraces the sequence diversity in comparison to the wild species was halved, with 81% of rare alleles lost [@hyten06] and two major bottlenecks when very few landraces were used in the development of the north american modern cultivars and then on to the breeding of the past 75 years in america to the elite cultivars there is now.

## Soy history in NWE (SBP) + CCA 700-900 [] draft1

### **transition**

### **SBP origin**

Together three sources, a paper called *Soybeans for cool temperate climates* by Sven A. Holmberg, published in 1973 presents the results of a soybean breeding program from 1939 to 1973, With two books, one about everything soybean in northwest Europe and the other about plant breeding in Sweden it is possible to piece together the story of the genetic source of soybean from the Nordgen genebank. Three cultivars were the result of the program Fiskeby V being the highest yielding and the tallest with, Bråvalla and Träff which are short and extremely early varieties, ripening 8 and 12 days earlier than Fiskeby V. 
Before the soybean breeding program in Fiskeby, several attempts were made with varieties mainly from Canada and Germany but didn't succeed, so in 1939-40, Sven A. Holmberg made a journey to sample collections in northern Japan and Sakhalin, Eastern Siberia. Locations were chosen, due to a summer climate similar to that of Sweden, and a long tradition of breeding soybeans. 
consisted of crossings between early, hardy, and low-growing varieties from these parts, and higher-growing varieties, mainly from Germany (with its origin in Manchuria).
There are primarily three characteristics that distinguish the soybean varieties from Holmberg’s breeding and are entirely essential to the adaptation to the Swedish climate: (1) Adaptation to long-day climate. (2) Tolerance against low summer temperatures. (3) Early ripening.

Unfortunately, even with the new Swedish varieties, Soybean yield was too unpredictable and too low to become a crop grown in Sweden, at the time. 
To this day, the soybean varieties from Fiskeby are well known among soybean growers worldwide, consisting of a source for early gestation and tolerance against low temperatures in breeding programs, wherever these characteristics could be incorporated.

## Conclusion and perspective (questions & possibilities) 350-500 words [] draft1

**The points from each subtopic are gathered into an overarching argument, an assessment or a conclusion that answers the problem set out in the introduction. Here, the author may identify shortcomings in the literature/science or provide perspective in another way.**


**Gather points to build the argument from the subtopics** **here starts the actual argument building for the consideration of growing soy in nothern climate**

agronomically it makes sense and it should be possible. Yeild ofcourse needs to be high enough. 


**what we dont know**

In this case, the problem is to determine whether the 136 soybeans in the NORDGEN gene bank could be of use, given the goal of growing more protein and oil rich crops in Northern Europe. It is important to address this question because it could lead to the development of a breeding program for a future crop in the region.

However, there are gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed. Firstly, it is unclear what exactly is contained within the NORDGEN accessions and how they relate genetically to the rest of the soy. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether there is any genetic potential or a good starting point for future breeding programs.

Although there are some known factors, such as the cultivar Fiskeby and a few other accessions that are thought to have potential, it is important to establish whether the founders were indeed the founders and whether the Swedish accessions are a genetic unit. Additionally, it is not clear if the selection of founders and succeeding breeding program selected for desirable traits or if it was simply a result of drift.

While there are areas of interest in the soybean genome, such as flowering and cold tolerance, it is necessary to look for diversity and signals of selection there. It is also important to understand how the CCA relates to the SBPA, and once these questions are answered, we can better understand how to proceed with optimal breeding for soybean in Northern and Western Europe.

In conclusion, the diversity within soybean is low, and the core collection is still too large to begin a breeding program. Additionally, the parameters, which are only weather and origin in comparison, are too few and phenotype data should be looked further into to see narrow down the potential accessions. However, the CCA provides a starting point, and there is potential within the NORDGEN accessions that could be added to this group making an even better potential which can be developed with further study and research.
