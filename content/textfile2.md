introduction part 2

Id like to start by introducing the data

and the historical metadata that we uncovered.

The preparation of the data done by Torben.

The filtering of the data for analysis done by me.

Analysis:

**part 1 (hypothesis 1.)**

Show the data visually in terms of relation.

A pca showing

- Wild soy.

- founders

- subset of land cultivars asia

- subset of elite culitivars South America

- SA (swedish accessions)

A PCA with

CCA and SA showing maturity score

Clustering groups and statistical analysis to show the founders and SA are or same origin.

phylogeny to see phylogenetic placement in relation to general soy population.

**Part 2 (hypothesis 2)**

Detect a decrease in genetic diversity as measure of sequence variation (Θ theta, Number of polymorphic sites in genotypic sample corrected for sample size).
Nucleotide diversity as (π pi, the expected heterozygosity per nucleotide site).  
LD increase.
Change in allele frequency FST. (Selection/Drift/geneflow)

 look at Fst for subset accessions representing:
 - Wild
 - CCA
 - To landrace/ Founders
 - to SA

 **Part 3 (hypothesis 3)**

 looking for signals of Selection
- Scan for selective signals over the genome  
- choose and introduce chosen parts of the genome.
- Allele frequence differentation (like Fst) at genes
- Haplotype analysis of genes




I guess this purpose of the research is two main things things.
1. the swedish accessions. what are they, where did they come from and what can i find out about them.

2. Then there is the genetic relevance of the swedish accessions in relation to the germpasm as a whole, and in relation to the core collection. 

To later be able to answer the question. Are these swedish accessions a starting point for breeding programs for northern european soybean breeding programs. 

The purpose of this investigation is to start the investigation of the swedish soybean accessions. Id like to answer some initial questions to have an overview of the genetic data before us. what are these swedish accessions
