Introduction
1
What is the problem?
There is 136 soybeans in the NORDGEN gene bank and we want to know if they could be of use. 
Why is it important?
It is important because it would be a good idea to be able to grow more protien and oil rich crops in Northern Europe.
What do we not know?
We dont know what we have. 
We dont know how these NORDGEN accessions relate genetically to the rest of the soy.
We dont know whether there is genetic potential or a good starting point for future breeding programs here. 

2
bit that we do know
we know that there is the Fiskeby which shows potential
we know there was a breeding programs
we susspect who the founders are
We know that Fiskeby has been used in canadian cultivars successfully

but... (smaller knowledge gap and transition to next paragraph)
but we want to show that the founders were indeed the founders
and that the swedish accessions are a genetic unit. 

3
bit that we do know:
but we do know there was a breeding program with resulting cultivars.
but... (smaller knowledge gap and transition to next paragraph)
but we would like to know if the selection of founders and succeeding breeding program if they did select for traits or of it was just drift?

4
bit that we do know:
we know there are aresas of interest in the soybean genome. 
but... (smaller knowledge gap and transition to next paragraph)
We would like to look for signals of selection there.

HOW will you adress this problem?
Experimental approach
Through PCA
